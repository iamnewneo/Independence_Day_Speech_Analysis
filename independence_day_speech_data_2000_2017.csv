DR. MANMOHAN SINGH CALLS FOR CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS IN PUBLIC LIFE

Following is the free rendering of the Prime Minister’s address to the nation, in Hindi, from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 58th Independence Day, today:

""My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters, and dear children - Greetings to all of you on this day, the anniversary of our Independence.

This is a day we salute our Tiranga and feel pride and joy in watching it fly high in the blue sky.  This is a day we remember and honour the leaders of our Freedom Movement for the struggle they waged under the inspiring leadership of Mahatma Gandhiji and for the victory they won against foreign rule. This is a day we thank our soldiers and security forces for their bravery and commitment. We salute them for their dedication and discipline - farmers, workers, teachers, professionals, scientists and our elected representatives. 

In every walk of life, each one of us contributes in our own way to the building of our dear Bharat. What is that Bharat that we all wish to build?

A Bharat that is just and humane.  
A Bharat that treats all its citizens as equals. 
A Bharat that is prosperous. 
A Bharat that lives in peace. 
A Bharat in which every person is literate and healthy.
A Bharat in which everyone who seeks work is able to find it, and works for a brighter future for all of us.  My greetings to all of you. 

As I stand here before you, I am reminded of the words of our first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, when he spoke to the Nation on the first anniversary of our Independence in 1948. At that time I was a young student, and looked upon the dawn of Independence as the opening up of new vistas of opportunities to build an India of our dreams. Panditji had then said, ""All of us talk of India and all of us demand many things from India. What do we give her in return?"" Panditji asked, and he said, ""India will ultimately give us what we give her of love and service and productive and creative work. India will be what we are: our thoughts and actions will shape her.""

Friends, I ask each one of you to remember these wise words of Panditji as you go about doing your work, be it on farms, in factories, in schools, in colleges, in government offices, in shops, in research laboratories. Our Nation is what we are. It will become what we make of ourselves. 

Brothers and sisters, it is one brick after another that helps make a building. Millions of bricks go to make a great building. In the same manner, the efforts of millions of people go into the formation of a nation. The process of nation building is a great enterprise of adventure and creativity. It requires all of us to work together, bonded by our love for our Motherland. This love flows from our identity as Indians. Whatever be our religion, region, language, caste or culture, we are all Indians and India is ours. 

Our strength derives from our unity in diversity. The principles of secularism, social justice and the equality of all before law are the defining feature of our nation. Today is a day we re-dedicate ourselves to the service of our Nation, and of each and every citizen, especially those less fortunate than us.  

This day comes for us in the middle of the monsoons. Each year 
  when we meet here and see the Tiranga being unfurled on the Red Fort, 
  we also look at the clouds above and wonder whether it would rain. This year 
  too we have looked at the skies with anxiety.	
In Andhra Pradesh I went to understand the problems of farmers, suffering from the impact of drought, and to hold the hands of the families that had lost their breadwinner due to the unbearable burden of debt. For miles together I could see no water. In Assam and Bihar I went to share the concern of people whose lives have been dislocated by floods. For miles without end I could see only water. Drought and floods are two fundamental problems that continue to bring suffering to our rural population. We need concerted action to deal with these perennial problems. 

Our government has already taken some steps to deal with them. We intend to take more steps in future. We need to insulate our people from the impact of drought by creating local level water security. We have to mobilize our people to come forward to take up the challenge of water conservation and management. We are committed to increasing public investment in irrigation and addressing the specific problems of each river basin, in an environment and people friendly manner. 

Water is a national resource, and we have to take an integrated view of our country’s water resources, our needs and our policies and water utilization practices. We need to ensure the equitable use of scarce water resources. 

The waters of our sacred rivers have for centuries nurtured our civilization. They are the threads that run through the fabric of our nation. We cannot allow these waters to divide us. I urge you and all our political leaders to take a national and a holistic view of the challenge of managing our water resources. 

Dealing with the problem of water is an important commitment we have made as part of our ""New Deal for Rural India"". We have also taken steps to address the problem of availability and access to credit in rural areas. The ""New Deal"" that rural India needs must encompass investment in irrigation, credit delivery, health care, availability of electricity, primary education, rural roads and the modernization of the infrastructure for agriculture. 

We must increasingly use modern science and technology to address the needs of dry land farming, the diversification of our cropping pattern, micro-irrigation and the quality of our livestock. Improving rural connectivity and access to information can enrich the farm community. Here Governmental initiative can be multiplied by the effort of private enterprise and community action.

Friends, more than three decades ago, Smt. Indira Gandhiji had given the call ""Garibi Hatao"". We have reduced the incidence of poverty to some extent, but there is much more remaining to be done. While liberalizing and modernizing our economy and enabling individual enterprise to blossom, we must pay special attention to the elimination of poverty and the empowerment of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Castes and minorities. Our development strategies for tribal areas must be adequately sensitive to their felt needs and aspirations.

The empowerment of women is an important priority and the education of the girl child is vital to it. Our children are our future. In framing our policies we must keep the interests of future generations in mind. The Government will pursue social and economic policies that are conducive to the proper growth and development of our children, investing in their education, health and nutrition. A healthy child makes a healthy nation.

Employment generation has not kept pace with demand for jobs. Government will address this deficiency in the growth process by encouraging the growth of small and medium enterprises, agro industries and sectors like tourism, where there is a high job potential. There is also an urgent need to provide employment in rural areas especially in areas suffering from prolonged drought. The ""Food For Work Programme"" will be an important part of our strategy to deal with this challenge. New investment in the infrastructure sector will also help generate new jobs. 

Our approach has to be one of seeking faster growth while ensuring that the benefits of growth are more evenly distributed. Our policies for higher economic growth and modernization will be combined with an emphasis on social justice, communal harmony, rural development, regional balance and concern for the environment. 

Dear Countrymen, from the National Common Minimum Programme, I have identified seven priority sectors for focused attention. These are agriculture, water, education, health care, employment, urban renewal and infrastructure. These Seven Sectors  (saat sutra) are the pillars of the development bridge we must cross to ensure higher economic growth and more equitable social and economic development. 

The concerns of most of our citizens revolve around what we do for agriculture, water, education, health and employment. We recognize that for the development of the country what we are able to do in the key infrastructure sectors like power, roads, railways, ports and airports is also critical. 

The plans and priorities of our government have been outlined in detail in the National Common Minimum Programme, in my first address to the nation and in the Finance Minister’s recent Budget speech. Today, I have no promises to make, but I have promises to keep.

The real challenge for me and for the Government at all levels is the challenge of implementation of our stated policies and programmes. Central, State and local bodies have to work together for Government to be an effective instrument of development for the benefit of our people. There are areas, in which the Government has to be actively engaged, like education, health care, roads, railways, high technology and defence. 

However, for Government to be able to deliver results, we must reform the functioning of government.  We have to make officials accountable - make Government more transparent. We have to make public enterprises more efficient. Citizens increasingly demand governments that are accountable to them.  They have a concern both for probity and efficiency in public affairs.  

Fellow Citizens, the question of ethics in public life has repeatedly agitated our people and we have tried to find Constitutional, legislative and administrative devices to deal with the challenge. The time has come for us to consensually evolve a code of conduct for all political parties, a code of ethics for all individuals in public life, and a code of best practices for the Government at all levels. On this solemn occasion let us resolve to work together to develop such a code of conduct in a consensual way so as to uphold the values enshrined in our Constitution. 

We must also look within our parties, and ourselves and ask ourselves what is the root cause of the decline in values in public life? How do we reform our public institutions, our political parties, and our government at various levels? When we launched economic reforms over a decade ago, we tried to liberate individual enterprise from the stranglehold of bureaucracy. We will continue to widen the space available for private enterprise and individual initiative.

But governments cannot be wished away, especially in a developing country like ours where the government has an important role to play. The challenge for economic reform today is to breathe new life into government so that it can play a positive role where it must.

But what is government? Government comprises people’s representatives and civil servants. The reform of government is, therefore, a reform of the way we, the elected representatives and officials, work in government. It is you, fellow citizens, as members of the civil society, who must mobilize your enormous resources in support of such reform. To make democratic institutions more accountable we are committed to take several steps to strengthen the lowest tier of panchayats and urban local bodies.  We need to build the capacity of decentralized bodies and their elected representatives and this is best done through effective transfer of funds and functions to them.

Today if we effectively utilize our decentralised system of governance through panchayat raj, we can take concerted action for more effective delivery of basic services such as primary education, public health and health care, providing safe drinking water and sanitation.  

When we talk of reforming government and of Panchayat Raj we are reminded of Rajiv Gandhi who took pioneering initiatives in both these areas. Also, nearly twenty years ago, Rajiv Gandhi first drew the nation’s attention to the newly emerging electronics and computer revolution then underway. The enthusiastic manner in which the young people of our country have participated in the information technology revolution, turning India into an ""IT super power"", is a tribute to the farsightedness of Rajivji.

It is a matter of satisfaction today that IT is enabling us to improve the standard of living of ordinary people even in remote areas. We will continue to explore ways in which modern technology can improve the lives of ordinary people. We will improve broadband access and enable the required investment in IT infrastructure.

We live in an age where science and technology have become an important determinant of power and wealth. For our country to attain its due place in the 21st century, it is necessary to integrate science and technology in to all our development processes. The promotion of scientific temper must truly become a massive national movement.

We cannot make higher education a prisoner of either bureaucracy or ideology. It must develop on the foundations of professional excellence and intellectual integrity. The pursuit of excellence and concern for social equity must inform all our educational processes. The revered                       Dr. Ambedkar recognized very early the importance of education in the empowerment of the under-privileged.  ""We may forego material benefits"", observed Dr Ambedkar, ""but we cannot forego our right and opportunities to reap the benefit of the highest education to the fullest extent.""

Dear Countrymen, ours is a vast country in which many States are as big as some countries of the world. For the benefits of development to reach all corners of the country the Centre and States have to work in a spirit of cooperative federalism. It is the responsibility of the central government to help States to realize our common and shared objectives of development. But, there is much that State and local governments can do to promote growth, social justice and welfare. They must raise the required resources to the extent feasible. Equally important, attention must also be paid to the quality and effectiveness of Government. 

I am concerned about the slow rate of growth of the backward regions, just as I am concerned about the economic distress of the less privileged sections of our society. 

	We will encourage new investment in less developed regions. We will help in strengthening developmental institutions there. Special attention must continue to be paid to governance and development in the North-Eastern States and in Jammu and Kashmir.  The pattern of development must be such as to create new opportunities for job creation so that the youth of these regions can look to the future with renewed hope and confidence. These regions of our country can benefit by improving rail and road connectivity and encouraging new investment.

Both the North-East and Jammu and Kashmir are the most beautiful regions of our country. If we can work together to create an environment conducive to development and tourism, these regions will prosper more. Peace, social and political stability and communal harmony are essential for economic development. People want such peace and stability so that they can lead safe, secure and normal lives and go about their work, relax and enjoy life.

We must fight all anti-national and anti-social forces that try to disrupt normal life. Be they terrorists or communal and other such divisive forces. Terrorism is a threat to our normal lives and we must all unite in fighting it. Violence has never helped in the progress and prosperity of any society. We will fight this menace to civilized existence with determination. There should be no doubts on this score. However, we are willing to talk to any group provided they abjure the path of violence.

Friends, today I want each of you to show the same degree of self-confidence that our freedom fighters showed, when they led our country to freedom, in your encounters with new markets and new opportunities. We have been an open society. But, in being open to the world, we have not lost our identity as a people. Again I remind you of what Gandhiji taught us. That our nation must be like a house built on firm foundations, whose windows are wide open to let the winds blow freely in every direction.

""I want the winds from every corner to blow through my house"" Gandhiji said, ""but I refuse to be swept off my feet by any of them"". That has been our attitude to the world, culturally and economically, for centuries.  We must continue to adopt that attitude even as we seek to build a more self reliant and modern economy. 

	It is such focused attention to development that will address the real concerns of our people today. It is by strengthening our economy and making our democracy more inclusive that we can walk tall in the comity of nations. It is because of our commitment to democracy and development that we also wish to live in peace in our neighbourhood and with the world as a whole. 

As a people we have always lived in peace with our neighbours in Asia and the Indian Ocean region. For centuries we welcomed with open arms both travellers and traders from different parts of the world. We ourselves set sail in search of markets and to spread the philosophies of our wise men. Even today we want to live in a neighbourhood of peace and prosperity. 

I assure our armed forces and security forces our unstinted support to their welfare and to the modernization of our defences. They have played an admirable role in the defence of our unity and integrity. Not only have they defended our frontiers but also at home they have readily helped whenever their services have been sought in rescue and relief operations and in the protection of the life and property of fellow Indians.

Even as we devote our attention to defence, we must pay heed to the needs of development. All our neighbours are, like us, developing countries whose priority will also have to be the improvement of the quality of life of their citizens. We are not only bound together by our common borders but also by our common destiny. The assurance of peace and prosperity in our neighbourhood is an important priority for us. Our Government will give the highest priority to building closer political, economic and cultural ties with all our neighbours. 

We have always been in favour of a purposive bilateral dialogue with Pakistan to resolve all outstanding issues. It is our intention to carry forward with firm resolve and sincerity the composite dialogue process with Pakistan. The edifice of peace that we wish to build must stand on the twin pillars of mutual trust and confidence. Of course, trends of cross-border terrorism and violence make our task more difficult and complex.

As far as our relations with China are concerned, the positive trends which commenced with Shri Rajiv Gandhi’s visit to China in 1988, have provided a sound basis for later trends in our bilateral ties. We are committed to strengthening and expanding these relations. We shall carry forward the process of discussion to resolve the boundary question with political vision and a practical approach.

We value the friendship of all nations, big and small and we will seek closer economic relations with all countries. As a democratic country of more than a 100 crore people we are destined to play an important and positive role in world affairs, in structuring a just international order.

As a people, Indians have contributed a great deal to the advancement of knowledge. We value the positive role that the people of Indian origin have played in other countries. People of Indian origin are our cultural ambassadors wherever they live. We value their contribution to the societies they now live in just as much as we value the contribution they make to India, the land of their ancestors. Indians abroad are our ""Brain Bank"". They have shown how enterprising we Indians can be if the environment is conducive. If the required infrastructure is provided and individual initiative is rewarded we can be as good as the best in the world.

At home, this is the challenge for our Government. To create the environment in which merit is recognized, hard work and creativity are rewarded. 

My dear countrymen, brothers and sisters, there are many things we must do in government to be able to meet your needs and fulfill your aspirations. This is a responsibility we have taken upon ourselves and as your representatives in government we are ultimately answerable to you. This is the essence of a democracy and I have accepted this responsibility with all humility.

The power of the people, however, is infinitely greater than the power of governments. But, it is by combining the two that we can make our nation truly great. However, as I have said already, there are limits to how much the government can do. Part of the solution lies in each one of us, in our families, in our communities. If we can all cooperate with one another and work together as a community there is much we can do without looking for intervention by the government. We have to revive the spirit of community service and the spirit of nationalism, especially among our youth. 

Our national movement is unique in world history because we secured our freedom through non-violent means and by igniting hope in the minds of ordinary people. Generations of young people have been inspired by the Mahatma, a frail and soft-spoken man who shook the foundations of the mighty British Empire. 

I want our youth to understand Mahatma Gandhiji’s message that each one of us has the power to do good for our nation if we are only so determined.  Let us all work together to revive that spirit of idealism,           self-sacrifice, discipline and unity of purpose that characterized our freedom struggle. I am confident that the people of this great nation have the will, determination and the resources to meet this challenge. India’s destiny beckons us to pool all our wisdom, experience and knowledge to make this future happen.

I am confident that this is possible and within our reach. Our government will do all that lies within its power to convert this dream into a living reality so that this ancient land of Bharat once again becomes a major powerhouse of both knowledge and creativity. I commit our government to the fulfillment of this sacred national task.

Dear Children, join me now and say: Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!""

PM’S INDEPENDENCE DAY CALL – ""ROZGAR BADHAO""

TEXT OF PRIME MINISTER’S INDEPENDENCE DAY ADDRESS
New Delhi, Sravana 24, 1927
August 15, 2005

	Following is the free rendering of the Prime Minister’s address to the nation, in Hindi, from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 59th Independence Day here today:

""My Dear Countrymen, Brothers and Sisters and Dear Children,

	Today is once again a day of joy and happiness when we all gather to celebrate the anniversary of our Independence.  On this sacred occasion, I greet you all.

	Fifty eight years ago, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had unfurled this glorious Tricolour for the first time from this historical place, thus fulfilling the centuries-old dream of crores of Indians to be independent from foreign rule.

	Next year, we will commence the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of the First Battle of Independence.  Through the celebrations, we will have a chance to once again remember the glorious freedom fighters of that great battle who had laid the foundations for our independence.  In 1857, Bahadurshah Zafar had declared the Battle for Independence from this same historic Red Fort.  The battle cry of Rani of Jhansi Lakshmi Bai, Peshwa Nana Saheb, Tantia Tope and Begum Hazrat Mahal of Lucknow was – ""Delhi Chalo"".  This cry was renewed with vigour and force by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and in 1947 this ambition was fulfilled.  Today, we have the opportunity of remembering their sacrifices.  We can also learn from their enthusiasm and self-confidence, a number of traits which will be useful in facing today’s challenges as well.

	Today is a day when we feel proud of and celebrate our victory in the struggle for independence.  This is a day of joy and happiness for all Indians, irrespective of where they reside in any part of the world.  It is also a day on which we remember our valiant soldiers and security forces, thank them for their bravery and commitment, and hope that they will continue to be alert in the service of the nation.

	Mahatma Gandhiji had also dreamt of the same independence when he launched the Dandi March 75 years ago.  Through that struggle, he shook the foundations of the greatest and most powerful empire the world had ever seen.  Today, we need to once again remember the sacrifice and commitment of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi and also his dreams for an independent nation.  We also need to reflect on how far we have been successful in fulfilling his dreams.

	What was the dream Gandhiji had of an independent India?  He had said, ""I will work for an India where the poorest of the poor feel that this country and this nation belongs to them and that they have a major role in its construction.  An India where there is no higher class or lower class among all people.  An India where all communities live in friendship and harmony.  An India where women have the same rights as men.""  He had also said, "" the Swaraj I dream of is a Swaraj of poor people.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that Swaraj cannot be complete till the poorest have a guarantee of being provided with the basic necessities of life"".  

	Have we come anywhere near this dream?  In the last one year, our attempt has been to build the India of Gandhiji’s dream.  The goal of our Government’s National Common Minimum Programme is also the same.  Last year on this very day, I had said from the Red Fort that I have no promises to make but only promises to keep.  In order to fulfil the promises, we have taken many important steps and have taken major decisions which will contribute to our nation’s progress.   While taking these decisions, the focus of our thoughts and attention has always been the aam aadmi.  The effort of our government has been that while we continue to make rapid economic progress, the benefits of this progress and growth must reach all sections of society in a fair manner.  Our vision is not just of economic growth, but also of a growth which would improve the life of the aam aadmi.  

 Our country is witnessing unprecedented economic growth at this point in time.  Last year, our economic growth rate was 7% and it is likely to be similar this year as well.  Our country has never witnessed such consistently high growth rates in the past.  I am confident that if we maintain this momentum of growth for the next 5-10 years, then it would be possible for us to eradicate poverty, ignorance, hunger and disease from our country.  This is not a dream but something that is possible in our times. 

It is not only us but the entire world, which is viewing India as an emerging power of these times.  The whole world is eagerly watching the manner in which India is making rapid economic progress.  And this economic growth is happening within the framework of a liberal democracy.  Our country is a multi-cultural, multi-religious, multi-lingual and multi-ethnic nation.  Nowhere in the world do we have an example of a country of a 100 crore people seeking their economic and social destiny within the framework of a democracy.  It is because of this that the entire world’s attention is riveted on us.  It is the result of our combined hard work that India today has made its mark on the world stage and we feel proud of our standing in the comity of nations.

Brothers and Sisters,

	It is my belief that India’s future is extremely bright and that this future is indeed, possible.  In order to achieve this, we need to focus on achieving rapid economic growth and on ensuring social justice.  It is only by walking on these two legs will we be able to ensure that the benefits of growth reach all sections of society.

	Last year, while addressing the nation on this day, I had mentioned that our growth is critically dependent on seven sectors which I called the ‘Saat Sutras’.  These seven sectors were – agriculture, irrigation, education, health, employment, urban renewal and infrastructure.  Today, we can review the progress made in these seven areas.  
 
Our maximum emphasis has been on agriculture.  Farmers are the backbone of our country and of our economy.  It is the result of their tireless efforts that we do not have any shortage of foodgrains in our country.  The entire country is grateful to them for this.  

	We must admit that the economic growth we have been referring to earlier has not yet fully reached every individual in our society.  This is particularly true in our rural areas.  The growth in agriculture has not been at the required pace.  Even today, over 60% of our population is dependent on agriculture and every farmer has a right to be a participant in our economic growth processes.  Hence, we have talked about giving a ‘new deal’ to our farmers.  We have taken a number of steps to alleviate the problems of our farmers, such as improving and enhancing the flow of agricultural credit, increasing investment opportunities and storage facilities, launching a National Horticulture Mission to increase the output and trade in fruits and vegetables, and promoting research and training in agriculture.  It is our goal that by 2007, there should be a Krishi Vigyan Kendra in every district.   Through this, the benefits of advanced research and training will reach all our rural bretheren. Large parts of our country are still dependent on rainfall and we will focus on removing the problems of farmers in dry land areas. We are considering setting up a National Rainfed Area Authority for this purpose.  It is our hope that in the coming years, agricultural growth becomes rapid and we have a new green revolution.  We are fully committed to achieving this.  

	It is not possible for our rural areas to develop in the absence of basic infrastructural facilities.  In order to improve basic infrastructure in rural areas, we have conceived an ambitious programme called ‘Bharat Nirman’.  In Bharat Nirman, one crore hectares of unirrigated land will be irrigated.  All villages whose population is 1000 or more, and 500 or more in hilly areas, will be connected with roads.  Two and a half crore houses will be given electricity connections, and through this, the entire country will be electrified.  Over 60 lakh houses will be built in villages. The remaining 74,000 habitations which do not have access to safe drinking water will be provided these facilities.  Each and every village will have at least one telephone connection.  I am confident that Bharat Nirman will ensure the rapid economic development of our rural areas.  

	In all our economic programmes, our policy has been to ensure the participation of the common man, particularly of those in rural areas.  They should feel that all programmes belong to them.  We have believed that the proper institutional mechanism to ensure their participation in the Panchayat system. Shri Rajiv Gandhiji had dreamt of Panchayati Raj many years ago. Today, zila, tehsil and village panchayats have a major responsibility to discharge. Our Constitution has placed the responsibility on panchayats, not only of ensuring economic development but also delivering social justice.  Bharat Nirman provides a unique opportunity to our panchayats to shoulder this immense responsibility by effectively implementing this programme. I am confident that panchayats will ensure Bharat Nirman becomes a milestone in our development process.  

	We are giving importance not only to our rural areas but also to the economic conditions in our urban areas.  Today, a third of our population lives in urban areas and keeping in mind the speed at which urbanization is taking place, the day is not far off when over 50% of India’s population will be residing in urban areas.  The foundations of our culture and society were laid thousands of years ago in the cities on the banks of Indus River.  We taught the world the basic concepts of urban planning.  However, today our cities are often unable to meet the basic needs of their residents on many counts.  We will be investing in urban areas and for this, a National Urban Renewal Mission has been launched.

	We have a large proportion of young people in our population.  We will need to invest in their education and health so that their future prospects are bright.  By doing so, our population will become our biggest asset.  

	It is necessary for every section of society to be literate and educated so that they can take advantage of our growth processes.  By strengthening Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, we are trying to ensure universalisation of primary education.  We are giving special emphasis to the education of the girl child. We need to make education joyful, interesting and meaningful so that children develop a desire to go to school. We need to pay particular attention to the education of first generation learners. We are resolute in our commitment to see that no child is deprived of the benefit of primary education.  It is our hope that in the near future, women are as       literate as men.  In order to achieve these goals, resources shall not be a constraint.  We are also committed to providing education to disabled children as well.  
 
	Along with primary education, we also need to pay attention to higher education. If India is seen around the world as a rising knowledge power, it is because of our Universities and Research Institutions. If we want to maintain our rapid economic growth, we need to improve the quality of these institutions and also create many more such institutions. Let us resolve to achieve excellence in academic work in the 150th anniversary year of the Universities of Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai. 

	However educated an individual may be, it is necessary for the person to be healthy in order to lead a happy life.  Through the National Rural Health Mission, we will provide the best primary health care facilities in each and every village. We are confident that by providing excellent primary health care, we will be able to improve the health of young mothers and children which will then lead to a consequent reduction in our population growth rate.  

	In the last fifty years, we have been able to control and eliminate many diseases which have been a scourge in our country.  Leprosy has been eliminated in 25 states.  Polio and T.B. are also being gradually brought under control. AIDS is now becoming a major national problem and we need to tackle this on a war-footing.  We need to have a mass movement to ensure that this disease is rapidly checked and its growth arrested.  We will also ensure that medicines are available to common people at reasonable prices.

	As I had mentioned earlier, the true test of development is the number of people who have secured employment and the number of families who have prospered as a result. As long as there is widespread unemployment in the country, we cannot claim that we are truly independent.  It is with this goal in mind that Smt. Indira Gandhi had given the nation the goal of ‘Garibi Hatao’.  Today, if we need to remove poverty, we need to create employment ""Rozgar Badhao"". In order to ensure that a minimum level of employment is available to everyone in rural areas, it is necessary to have an employment guarantee.  The National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill has been prepared with this goal in mind.  We hope that this Act will bring about a revolutionary change in the lives of people in rural India.  We are also revamping the Khadi and Village Industries Commission so that more employment is generated through small and village industries.

	In order to ensure that our economic growth does not slow down, it is necessary to have strong infrastructure.  Economic growth is intrinsically linked to the availability of infrastructure.  Railways, roads and electricity are important elements of infrastructure.  In order to improve our railways, a rail modernization programme has been prepared so that our railways become one of the best in the world.  A dedicated freight corridor is being developed between Delhi-Kolkata and Delhi-Mumbai by investing over Rs. 25,000 crore rupees.

	The development of our national highways is progressing at a rapid pace.  We have begun work on an additional 30,000 km of highways and we will soon be six-laning the Golden Quadrilateral. There has been tremendous progress in civil aviation. World class airports are being constructed in many cities.  Ports are being modernized and many new ports are under construction.

	Shortage of electricity is still a major inconvenience.  Electricity is an essential ingredient of economic development.  We need to ensure that electricity generation grows rapidly and that power shortages are eliminated. We need far greater investment in this sector. I have often said that, excepting for the poorest sections of society, giving electricity free of cost to other sections will worsen the financial condition of our electric utilities.  We need to get used to paying a reasonable price for electricity just as we do for petroleum products.  Through this, we can ensure supply of electricity in the right quantity, at the right time and of right quality.  In my visit to the United States, we have managed to reduce some of the constraints which have been hampering the growth of our nuclear energy programme and in the next 10 years, in addition to the 1,50,000 MW of capacity being added in the thermal and hydro sectors, another 40,000 MW could be generated through nuclear energy.

	While rapid economic growth is one facet of our vision for the nation, social justice and equitable development is the other facet.  Last year, our greatest contribution to the nation has been to bring it back on the path of rapid economic growth.  There is a ray of hope in the lives of all weaker sections of society.  There is an atmosphere of calm, peace and communal harmony all around the country.  We believe that this is an important achievement.

	In our country, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, backward classes and women suffer from many disabilities.  Many of them have been discriminated against for centuries.  It is essential that they are made stakeholders and participants in our development processes.  We are committed to paying attention to their education, health and basic necessities.  We have taken some steps to improve their economic and social status.  A Bill has been introduced in Parliament on reservation in government employment.  It will be our effort now to increase the opportunities for employment and equal opportunities in employment outside Government.

	Our Adivasi brothers have been cultivating land near forests for many generations.  However, they do not have any rights on this land owing to which they live in constant fear of eviction.  Their rights were snatched away from them 150 years ago during British rule.  In order to correct this, we are bringing a legislation which will benefit scheduled tribes living in forests while at the same time ensuring conservation of our natural heritage.

	Our Constitution provides for equality of all religions.  All religions are safe and secure within our Republic.  It is essential that minorities should have every opportunity of carrying on their daily activities with a feeling of security and happiness.  This is also our goal.  Hence we have repealed POTA.  As a result, many sections of society are able to breathe easy.  We have commissioned a report on the social economic status of minorities.  This is being done for the first time and will be the basis for all our policy interventions for improving their status. We will also revive and revamp the 15 Point Programme for Minorities. The New 15 Point Programme will have definite goals which are to be achieved in a specific time frame. 

We are going to start a special development programme which will focus on the skill enhancement of artisans and weavers, many of whom are minorities.  This will help improve their incomes. 

	Industrial growth is the result of the sweat and toil of our working classes.  This year, our industrial growth in May has exceeded 10%.  I would like to congratulate all our workers for this magnificent result.  The Government will pay specific attention towards addressing the problems of workers, particularly those in the unorganized sector.  It is our hope that we will be able to provide a social security net for them so that they do not feel insecure in times of distress.  However, I would like to emphasize that workers too have a responsibility.  Wherever they may be working, in factories or in firms, they should work in cooperation with the management so that profitability of enterprises increases and they also benefit from this.

	Women are the backbone not only of our homes but also of our nation.  We need to strengthen their hands and empower them fully.  We have brought legislation to prevent domestic violence against women and to secure their property rights.  We will also ensure reservation for women in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies.  

	In order to provide an opportunity for our youth and sportspersons to demonstrate their skills, we will make all possible efforts to ensure that India once again hosts the Asian Games in Delhi, the first since 1982.

	In this new phase of development, we are acutely aware that all regions of the country should develop at the same pace.  It is unacceptable for us to see any region of the country left behind other regions in this quest for development.  In every scheme of the Government, we will be making all efforts to ensure that backward regions are adequately taken care of.  This has been ensured in the Food for Work Programme and the National Rural Health Mission.  We will also focus on the development of our border areas.  We will ensure that these regions are provided basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity and telephone connectivity.

	Our rivers are the lifelines of the country.  They are the foundations of our ancient civilization.  Today the demand for water is growing all around. In the 21st century, water will the most precious commodity and its shortage will be felt all around. We need to launch a national movement to prevent the wastage of water and for its efficient use.  This is an absolute necessity.  It is also necessary that all states of our country work together in a spirit of give and take and a spirit of mutual understanding to sort out all contentious issues amicably so that everyone is benefited.  

	We also need to pay special attention to our environment. We need to start a national campaign for cleanliness – so that our cities, towns, villages, roads, streets and homes are neat and clean. Gandhiji used to emphasise this aspect in his Ashram as well. We need to stop the pollution of our rivers and atmosphere. We need to protect our forests and natural heritage. We must remember that we are only the custodians of our environment and it is our responsibility to preserve and pass it on to our future generations. 

	In the recent past, natural calamities have affected many parts of our country with disastrous effects on people and property.  A tsunami in December, snowfall in January and floods in July.  Lot of people have lost their precious lives in these calamities.  The entire nation’s sympathies are with the bereaved families.  I am confident that we will face the problems of floods in a united manner, just we faced the devastation caused by the tsunami.  Last month, Mumbai suffered immense damage and lost many lives because of unprecedented floods.  In these difficult circumstances, the citizens of Mumbai have shown courage fortitude and patience in dealing with the enormous problems and have demonstrated the qualities which make Mumbai different from other cities.   I would like to assure that we will provide whatever assistance is required to ensure that Mumbai, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka are restored to normalcy. In order to effectively tackle such natural calamities, we have constituted a National Disaster Management Authority.  Through this, and by using the latest technologies, we hope to face future calamities in a much better manner.

	In the country, we still have regions such as Jammu & Kashmir and the North-East where complete peace and tranquility does not exist.  The people in these regions are the victims of violence and terrorism.  Wherever conditions deteriorate we take the assistance of our Armed Forces.   Wherever we have taken their assistance, they have shown patience and perseverance.    Many of them have lost their lives.   In order to ensure that the children of soldiers who have laid down their lives in the service of the nation get good education, we are starting a Prime Minister’s Scholarship Scheme.  Each year, 5000 children would be provided scholarships for college education.

	However, accidents do happen once in a while.  Keeping this in mind and with a view to protecting human rights, the Government had set up a Committee to look into the provisions of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.  The Report of this Committee is being examined in detail and we will take all necessary steps so that there are no violations of human rights under this Act.

	As a result of our policy in Jammu & Kashmir, the State is once again on the path of peace and progress.  It is our humanitarian obligation that we assist the State in all possible ways so that the people there can live in peace and harmony.  Terrorists have never been the friends of the people of Kashmir.  As long as they continue their terrorist attacks, our Armed Forces will be alert and give them a fitting response.  In this conflict, common citizens may also be affected at times.  I have said before and I am repeating once again, that there is no issue that cannot be resolved through a process of discussion and dialogue.  Our doors are always open and will continue to be open for anyone interested in dialogue.  I invite everyone to join us to discuss the problems of the state of Jammu & Kashmir so that its people can lead a life of peace and dignity.  If violence continues, then our response too will be hard.  I am aware that the Government of Pakistan has put some checks on the activities of terrorists from its soil.  However, it is not possible to achieve success through half-hearted efforts.  It is necessary that the entire infrastructure of terrorism is totally dismantled.  
 
	In the context of terrorism and extremism, development and security have an intrinsic relationship.  We have managed to face extremism successfully through a democratic process.  However, it is imperative that a democratic government should be able to differentiate between the genuine problems of people and the designs of terrorists.  Today, there are a number of challenges in our security environment such as terrorism, communal violence, atrocities on women and exploitation of dalits and adivasis.  Our security forces have been facing the daunting task of controlling extremist violence admirably.  Extremism is a challenge which requires a united response from all of us.  However, it is also necessary to look at a political resolution of this problem.  Often extremism has its roots in backwardness and lack of economic development.  It is not easy to handle problem of extremism in violation.  However, by addressing it in all its dimensions — social, political, economic and security — in an integrated manner, I am confident that we will be successful in checking it.

	India has always been a country which loves peace.  Its destiny is intrinsically linked to those of its neighbours.   Our goal has always been the prosperity and happiness of our citizens.  Hence, we have always sought the friendship of our neighbours, although at times, this has not been fully successful.  There seems to be some success in our search for peace and harmony now.  Many problems of South Asia are similar, of which poverty and illiteracy are the most widespread.   It is possible for us to eliminate these in the region by working together.

	The composite dialogue process with Pakistan is continuing.  As a result, we have been able to reopen the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad highway which was a long pending demand of the people and restarted the bus service on this route, a step which has been widely welcomed.  Talks are going on to open similar links from points in other states.

	Discussions are also going on a gas pipeline from Iran to India via Pakistan.  Once this is completed, we will be able to address a major constraint affecting our economy.

 It is our sincere hope that we work with all our neighbours in South Asia to effectively address the challenges of poverty, unemployment and disease.  If India and Pakistan are able to work together, than we will have many opportunities for making our countries prosperous.  I am confident that we will be able to fulfill this vision.

	We have had historic links and relations with Afghanistan. It is our desire to see Afghanistan prosperous and strong. In a few days, I will be going to Afghanistan. We will try to strengthen and support democracy and economic growth in all possible ways.  

	Our largest neighbour is China with whom we have a centuries-old relationship, a relationship from which both of us have learnt a lot and imbibed a lot.  We are today willing and ready to deepen our trade and cultural relations with China for the benefit of the two nations.  The agreement arrived at between our two countries in April has paved the way for a closer relationship.

	I greet the people of Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives and Myanmar and assure them with utmost sincerity that India is willing to work together with them for promoting development, prosperity and peace in the region.

	My visit to the United States has been a major step in promoting friendship with that country.  By deepening our economic and technological relations, we will be accelerating our own growth.  Simultaneously, our two democracies can work together to strengthen democracy in the world.  Russia is an old friend who has helped us in difficult times.  We will deepen our friendly relations with Russia.

	We also wish to deepen our relations with the countries to the East.  The recently concluded trade agreement with Singapore is a major step in improving our economic engagement with the region.  We will be entering into many more such agreements in future.

	At this point, I would like to emphasize that the contribution of Indians and persons of Indian origin settled abroad in ensuing that our efforts are successful is enormous.  They have not only traveled to far off lands to achieve their dreams of prosperity for themselves and their children, but have also played a stellar role in changing the world’s perception of India.   The world today sees India as a major knowledge power whose people are skilled, competent, hard working and peace loving.  Even within our own country, our scientists, doctors, engineers and scholars have contributed substantially in the achievements of our nation.    We are proud of all of them.

	To conclude, I would like to say that the biggest challenge in running a Government is to ensure that development programmes are implemented in an effective manner.  We will ensure that our outlays of expenditure are visible to citizens as outcomes of progress.  The Central Government, State Governments and Panchayats have to work together so that the expectations of people are fulfilled.  If we have to achieve results, there is a need to change the manner in which governments function.  There is no space in our government or in our society for corruption and arbitrary action.  We are not prepared to tolerate this at any cost.  Government servants must work with a sense of public service and they should be held accountable to the people.  Governments will have to be made more transparent and accountable.  The recently passed Right to Information Act is a landmark step in this direction.

 India is on the road to progress. The whole world is watching us with expectation. It is possible for us to eradicate poverty, ignorance and disease within our lifetime. This has been made possible by the advances in science and technology. 

There comes a time in the history of a nation when it can be said that the time has come to make history. We are today at the threshold of such an era. The world wants us to do well and take our rightful place on the world stage. There are no external constraints on our development. If there are any hurdles, they are internal.

We must seize this moment and grab this opportunity. We need to have the resolve to make our country prosperous. We must have the self confidence to realise that we are second to none, that Indians are as good as the best. Our political system and leadership must show sagacity, wisdom and foresight so that we are able to make the best of this moment and make India a truly great nation. 

Let us come together, as one nation, strengthened by our plurality, to work shoulder to shoulder and build a new India. An India where there are no barriers between the government and the people. An India where each and every Indian can stand proudly and proclaim that he is an Indian. Let us work together to build such a nation.

Dear children, join me and say Jai Hind!, Jai Hind!, Jai Hind!"".

                Text of Prime Minister’s Independence Day Address


Following is the free rendering of the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh’s  address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort  in Hindi on the occasion of the 60th Independence Day here today:-

“My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters, and dear children  

My greetings to all of you on this day, the anniversary of our Independence.

1. 	Today is a very auspicious day for our country. Today we enter the 60th year of our Independence. Today we re-dedicate ourselves to the progress and prosperity of our nation. To the welfare of all our people. To the unity and integrity of our country. 

2.	Today we salute our beloved tricolor. We pay tribute to the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi and all those freedom fighters because of whose efforts and sacrifices we secured our Independence. We remember all those whose hard work and efforts keep our flag flying high and keep our country on the road to progress. We pay tribute to the brave members of our armed forces, farmers, teachers, scientists, workers and the millions of our countrymen who are toiling tirelessly for the progress and prosperity of our nation. 

3.	In the early hours of the 15th of August, 1947, when our nation had just become Independent, our first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru spoke to the nation and asked us all one important question on the very first day we became a free country: “Are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?” 

4.	Today, my fellow citizens, I stand here once again and ask you that same question. Are we ready to face the challenge of the future? Are we brave enough, to do so, and wise enough, in doing so?  Can we rediscover the ideas and ideals that shaped our freedom struggle, and use them to take our country forward into the future? Are we willing to show the courage and the wisdom that Panditji wanted us to show in building a new India in a new world?

5.	The going has never been as good for India in the past as it is now. Our economy has been growing at an impressive pace of over 8%. Such rapid growth over three successive years is unprecedented in Indian history. Wherever I go, I see our nation on the move. Our industry and services sectors are showing impressive growth. I see a reassuring confidence in our industry in being able to take on the challenge of the rest of the world. The growth of the manufacturing industry has touched 11% in the last quarter, generating many jobs for our youth and workers. I see our service sector competing with the best and earning valuable foreign exchange. 

6.	All around us, we see new roads being built. The railways are expanding their reach. New power plants are being built. New airports are being planned. Vast industrial estates and Special Economic Zones are coming up. This dynamism is the result of the enterprise, creativity and hard work of millions of Indians. They are boldly taking our country into the future, treading on untrodden paths. I am sure this will result in far greater prosperity for our people. I sincerely believe that the most effective way to banish poverty is to generate growth which in turn will create new opportunities for gainful employment. Hence, economic growth is of primary importance for us.

7.	It is almost sixty years since Independence.  It is but a brief period in the history of an ancient civilization. But, it is a long time in the life of a young nation. In these sixty years, the world has been transformed beyond recognition. The empires of Europe have faded away. New powers have emerged in Asia. Look at where Japan was and where it is today. Look at where China was and where it is today. Look at where the countries of South-east Asia were and where are they today? When I see them, I wonder whether we are living up to our full potential or not.

8.	India is certainly on the march. Yet, we have miles to go before we can truly say that we have made our tryst with destiny. Sixty years ago, Panditji told us that the two challenges before a free India was to end the ancient scourge of poverty, ignorance and disease and end the inequality of opportunity. India has marched a great distance forward in these sixty years, but the challenge of banishing poverty remains with us. We have yet to banish hunger from our land. We have yet to eradicate illiteracy. We have yet to ensure that every Indian enjoys good health. 

9.	There is visible progress all around. However, when I see this, I have some worries. And I am aware, that every Indian has similar worries. Even as we move forward rapidly, to claim our rightful place in the comity of nations, I see that there are vast segments of our people who are untouched by modernization; who continue to do backbreaking labour; who continue to suffer from iniquitous social orders.  I see that our farmers in many parts are in a crisis, not managing to eke out a decent living from their land. When I visited Vidarbha, the plight of the farmers there made a deep impact on me. The agricultural crisis that is forcing them to take the desperate step of committing suicide needs to be resolved. We need to think about how we can provide a decent livelihood to our farmers?  

10.	When I see large development projects coming up, while one rejoices at the progress that is being made, one worries for those who are displaced, for those who have lost their land and livelihood. When one sees our cities growing rapidly, one sees visible progress but at the same time, one worries for the large number of people who live in their slums. When our industry and services compete successfully across the globe, we celebrate our success in global markets; but at the same time, we are buffeted by the same global forces when oil prices go up because of factors beyond our control. Globalisation certainly has its benefits; but it can also hurt the common man. 

11.	The big challenge for us as a nation is to address this duality - to ensure that while we keep the wheels of progress moving rapidly forward, no section of society and no part of the country is left behind; to ensure that growth generates the necessary wealth which can then finance the welfare of marginalized groups; to ensure that growth generates employment and a bright future for our youth.

12.	 In the past two years, it has been our endeavour to address these concerns. We have taken many steps to expand employment opportunities and improve the quality of life in rural and urban areas.

13.	The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act has been enacted to provide income security for those suffering from extreme poverty. The programmes under this Act, for which more than 2 crore families have already registered, currently cover 200 districts and will be expanded gradually to cover the entire country. This pathbreaking Act is the most important social safety net for our poor. I am confident that this Act will help us in eradicating poverty. 

14.	Bharat Nirman is another programme which will modernize our villages. As our villages get fully electrified and get connected by roads and telephones, their economies will prosper. As they get better irrigation facilities, their agriculture will grow. As drinking water and housing facilities improve, their living conditions will improve. They will participate in the growth which is already visible in urban India.  I am happy that progress in the first year of Bharat Nirman has been good and by 2009, I expect to see visible results across the country.

15.	These programmes are our weapons in the “War on Poverty”. The most effective weapon against poverty is employment. And, higher economic growth is the best way to generate employment. We must create an environment that encourages business to grow and create more employment, especially in the manufacturing sector. We have created a conducive environment for our industrial enterprises to flourish and the results of this are visible. We are supporting not just large industries, but also the labour intensive small scale and handloom sectors through special programmes. Handlooms and textile industries employ over 3.5 crore people. We are giving cheaper loans to this sector and handloom cooperatives are being revitalised.  I am hopeful that in the coming years, lakhs of jobs will be generated in these sectors.

16.	Two years ago, speaking from the Red Fort, I talked of “New Deal for Rural India”. There is much we have done, but I know much more needs to be done. We have kept our word and almost doubled agricultural credit in less than three years as promised. We are providing short term loans to farmers at 7%. We have waived interest on over-due loans for debt-stressed farmers in Vidarbha and will do the same in other suicide affected districts. We are trying to reach institutional credit to each and every farmer so that they are out of the clutches of moneylenders. For this, we are reviving the cooperative banking system for which a Rs 13,000 crore package is being implemented. We have been paying special attention to horticulture, animal husbandry, cotton, sugarcane and other crops. A National Fisheries Development Board has been set up for increasing the livelihood of fishermen. Agricultural research is being improved and Krishi Vigyan Kendras will soon be functioning in every district of the country by the year end. 

17.	However, I admit that much still needs to be done to improve the prospects for farmers. Especially in rain-fed areas and for dry-land agriculture. We will need to work towards ensuring more remunerative prices for our farmers. I am aware of the acute distress of our farmers who bear the burden of heavy debt. We have recently constituted an expert group to look into the problem of agricultural indebtedness. I am confident that in a few months, we will take concrete measures to help our farmers overcome the burden of crushing debt. Most importantly, we must ensure that more people get employment in manufacturing and services so that the disproportionate burden on agriculture in providing a livelihood to two-thirds of our population gets reduced. 

18.	The results of our efforts to improve agriculture are clearly visible in some places. Farmers are getting better prices for many crops. This helps them earn a better livelihood. This, on the other hand hurts the common man when the prices of essential food commodities go up. We need to understand that if we want better prices for farmers so that they earn a better livelihood, the prices of what they produce and sell will have to go up! We certainly cannot grudge our farmers better incomes when incomes of other sections of society are rising! In order to ensure that the needy and the poor do not get adversely affected, our government is committed to ensuring adequate availability of essential commodities at affordable prices to them.	
 
19.	I know that each of our families is concerned about the prices of essential commodities. Let me assure you that we will do whatever is required to keep prices under check. But I must remind you that two years ago the international price of oil was just over $30 per barrel. Today it is close to $75. Even though world oil prices have more than doubled, we have succeeded in insulating our consumers to a great extent. Prices of kerosene and LPG have not been raised. But there is a limit to which we can go on subsidizing the consumption of petroleum products in the face of rising import costs. How much more can the government treasury bear this burden? At some point, this will affect our ability to spend on other important development programmes. In order to keep food prices within the reach of the common man, we have even allowed the import of some products to meet the shortage in our markets. 

20.	While employment and agriculture are of immediate concern to all, our long term concern is for the future of our children. They need to be healthy, well educated, with hope for the future. We launched the National Rural Health Mission to provide better health care in rural areas. Under this programme, almost 2 lakh women have been kept as health assistants (ASHAs) at the village level; 4 lakh more women will be in place soon. Through them, we will wage a war against malnutrition of children, against malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and other diseases. These diseases put a heavy financial burden on our people. In Vidarbha, I was pained to meet families of farmers who had committed suicide because they could not repay the loans they had taken to meet the cost of health care of their loved ones. We will take every possible step to help people overcome the burden of poverty and disease. 

21.	The expanded Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan will ensure that all our children go to school. Under the universal Mid-day Meal Programme, almost 12 crore children are getting a nutritious meal at school.  Through these two programmes, we will ensure that all our children complete basic schooling. I request every citizen to ensure that every child of school-going age is enrolled in a school. We will pay particular attention to the empowerment through education of children belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Minorities. We will provide all possible assistance for the all round growth of children suffering from disabilities or with special needs. We also will care for those who suffer from disabilities so that they can lead a dignified life in society. 

22.	All the initiatives that we have taken to push forward rural development and ensure farmers’ welfare can be implemented only with the active participation of our panchayats. For this to happen, our State Governments have to empower our panchayats. We have to pay more attention to the quality of local administration – in our villages and districts, in our towns and cities. We need to rid our municipalities of the cancer of corruption. State governments have a major role to play in this. 

23.	Cities and towns are centers of growth and generators of employment opportunities. Our cities need to have a new look for which they need massive investment and renewal. They need basic amenities like sanitation, drinking water and proper housing for the poor. They need public transport, parks and playgrounds. We need cities in which the working poor can live with self-respect and dignity; cities in which children and women feel safe and secure. In order to ensure that our cities have better infrastructure and that they have better living conditions, we launched the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. This programme and other similar ones have started showing results. Work has begun on Metro systems in Bangalore and Mumbai. I see a glorious decade of city development ahead of us. 

24.	The massive challenge before Government is to implement these programmes. We have to improve the way governments function and deliver public services. How do we do this? How do we ensure that higher financial outlays translate into better outcomes? I sincerely hope that the Right to Information Act enacted by our Government will empower our people who will be able to use their rights to make government more accountable. We have to work hard to eliminate corruption in the delivery of public services, in fact eliminate it from all walks of life. We will work to put in place a system that rewards honesty, probity and efficiency.  

25.	India has contributed extensively to human knowledge. Today, we are at the dawn of a new millennium which many call the knowledge economy. In this world, knowledge will determine our progress and the place we occupy in the world. We must continue to be at the forefront of new research and new thinking, especially in science and technology. We must build top-class institutions. We have begun work on three new Indian Institutes of Science, Education and Research in Kolkata, Pune and Punjab. We have also begun work on 19 medical institutions of the same standard as AIIMS. We will need to ensure far greater availability of educational opportunities at the higher education level so that we have not just a literate youth but a skilled youth, with skills which can fetch them gainful employment. As our economy booms and as our industry grows, I hear a pressing complaint about an imminent shortage of skilled employees. As a country endowed with huge human resources, we cannot let this be a constraint. We are planning to launch a Mission on Vocational Education so that the skill deficit in our economy is addressed. 

26.	As we expand educational opportunities, we must ensure that these opportunities are accessible to all marginalized and weaker sections of our society. Our government is committed to providing reservation in educational institutions for students from socially backward sections of society. We will do so, while at the same time expanding educational opportunities for all youth. This is our solemn commitment. In this manner, we will recognize and reward individual merit and hard work while working for an inclusive society. 

27.	While we are moving fast to develop every region of our country, we have to take pains to see that this does not adversely affect those who are displaced. Nor should it affect our environment. Nor should any region of the country get left behind. Our government will soon put in place a comprehensive Rehabilitation Policy so that displacement does not lead to impoverishment and those who lose their land benefit from subsequent economic development. We have also taken special measures to save our wildlife, including the tiger. We are taking concrete steps to develop backward regions through the Backward Regions Grant Fund and will be spending Rs 5000 crores annually in 250 districts. 

28.	Our other concern is national security. India is facing two major threats to its internal security. Terrorism and Naxalism.  Just over a month ago, Mumbai witnessed the most inhuman terrorist attack in the recent past, killing and injuring hundreds of innocent citizens. The entire nation was pained by this suffering. Mumbai demonstrated its courage and patience and showed its resolve not to be cowed down by these incidents. 

29.	I had said in Mumbai then that it cannot be business as usual for any of us. Terrorists want to undermine our growing economic strength; destroy our unity; and provoke communal incidents. We cannot allow this to happen. Our strength lies in our unity.  We will not allow the secular fabric of our country to be broken. 

30.	I give my assurance to every citizen that we will do our utmost to preserve our unity and integrity, to make our country safe and secure for every citizen. We will modernize, strengthen and properly equip our security forces and our intelligence agencies. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that terrorist elements in India are neutralized and smashed. Let those who want to hurt us by inflicting a thousand cuts remember – no one can break our will, or unity. No one can make India kneel. 

31.	While terrorism has been raising its ugly head time and again, we have also seen peace having its victories. The people of Jammu and Kashmir continue to face the wrath of terrorism. But they have also seen new rays of hope for peace and progress.  New links of connectivity have brought people on both sides of the Line of Control closer – Srinagar to Muzaffarabad, Poonch to Rawalkot. Through the Round Table Conferences, we have started a dialogue with all political groups and parties of Jammu and Kashmir. We are jointly exploring new pathways to build a better tomorrow for its people – a tomorrow where they can live in peace and dignity, free from fear, want and exploitation. 

32.	Today the people of the North-Eastern region look to the future with hope. The last two years have seen immense progress in the North East in all spheres of development – better roads, better rail connectivity, the first ever thermal power projects in the region and better universities. I am hopeful that in the coming few years, the North-eastern region will gradually catch up with the rest of the country. However, many states here are still afflicted by insurgency. There is a great desire among the people of the region for peace and tranquility. While we are determined to tackle insurgency, we are hopeful that the dialogue that we have initiated with many disaffected groups will produce a peace dividend. A life of progress and prosperity with self-respect and dignity is the right of the people there and we are confident of providing it. 

33.	I want those who have mistakenly taken to Naxalism to understand that in democratic lndia, power will never flow from the barrel of a gun. Real power flows from the ballot box. At the same time, our State Governments must pay special attention to the welfare of our tribals and small and marginal farmers. It is their distress that Naxalites exploit. The path of violence can never solve the problems of the poor. Our security forces will respond appropriately to the violence unleashed by Naxalites.

34.	In the past one month, many parts of the country, particularly Andhra Pradesh, Surat and Maharashtra, have been badly affected by floods and there has been extensive loss of life and property. We will provide all possible assistance for the relief of these regions. 

35.	Every Indian wants to live in a neighbourhood of peace, stability and prosperity. People in our neighbouring countries share the same aspirations. South Asia is a common cultural and economic unit. Our past and destinies are inter-linked. India, as the largest country in the region, is ready to give our neighbours a stake in our own prosperity and share the fruits of our growth with them. However, the dream of a South Asian community, where borders have ceased to matter and there is an unhindered flow of goods and peoples, culture and ideas, can hardly be realized if terrorist violence and the politics of hate and confrontation continue to cast a dark shadow.

36.	We are prepared to work together with all our neighbours to usher in an era of peace and prosperity for our peoples. We have taken several initiatives in this regard, in particular with Pakistan. To be successful, these initiatives need an atmosphere of peace. It is obvious that unless Pakistan takes concrete steps to implement the solemn assurances it has given to prevent cross-border terrorism against India from any territory within its control, public opinion in India, which has supported the peace process, will be undermined. All countries in our region must recognize that terrorism anywhere is a threat to peace and prosperity everywhere. It must be confronted with our united efforts. There is a large constituency for peace and shared prosperity among our people and we must work together to build on that. 

37.	In the past two years, we have succeeded in creating an international environment which supports our development aspirations. Our relations with the United States of America, Russia, China, Japan, and the European Union, have never been better and with Russia, we have further strengthened our time-tested partnership. In South-East Asia, India has been welcomed into the East Asian Summit. There has been a significant expansion of both our political and economic links with countries of the Gulf and the Arab world. The continents of Africa and Latin America are now the new areas of focus for our diplomacy and India’s engagement has become truly global.  We are recognized for the scale of our achievements since Independence and the world wants India to progress. 

38.	India is a young nation. India is a nation of young people. Our youth are ready to work hard for a bright future. Our former Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, was greatly concerned about the prospects for our youth and took many steps for ensuring a bright future for them. 

39.	Even today, the youth of our country are in search of a bright future. They seek new opportunities and are in search of new possibilities. They are willing to think in new ways. They have no time for old ideas and ideologies. They want to build a new India. We must build a new India of their dreams. I want every one of our youth to  walk shoulder to shoulder, and walk forward with us in building a new India. Every young person must have faith in our future. To know that this country will create opportunities for all for the full expression of their talent and skill. 

40.	We have a dream of an India in which every woman can feel safe, secure and empowered. Where our mothers, sisters and daughters are assured a life of dignity and personal security. We must end the crime of female foeticide. We must eliminate gender disparities. We must see that every young woman is educated and skilled and capable of guiding a new generation.  

41.	The laws of our land are meant to protect every law abiding citizen. The rule of law can become a reality only if justice is seen to be delivered. Only if the rights of law-abiding citizens are protected. We need a more efficient, humane and responsive police force. We also need a more efficient and effective judiciary. Our government will work to make this possible.

42.	Today, from this historic Red Fort, I appeal to every one of you to re-dedicate yourself to build a new India. 
-	An India that is united in thought, not divided by religion and language. 
-	An India that is united in our Indianness, not divided by caste and region. 
-	An India that is united in seeking new opportunities for growth, not divided by disparities. 
-	An India that is caring and inclusive.

43.	Our religions may be different. Our castes may be different. Our languages may be different. But we are all Indians. In our progress lies the progress of the nation. Our fortunes and our nation’s fortunes are intertwined. And working together, we can make this fortune a glorious one. 

44.	If we have to fulfil our potential, we need a politics that will help us realize it. We need a politics that will propel us forward. We need a politics that will guide us to new frontiers, take us to new horizons. I urge all our political leaders to think deeply about the future of our country. We must shun the politics of divisiveness and adopt the politics of change and progress. Our political parties and leaders must learn to work together. To build a consensus around national issues. If we are able to do so, then I am confident that then we will soon be able to realize the golden future which millions of our countrymen are eagerly waiting for.

45.	Let us all join together, hand in hand, to build a new India. 

Jai Hind!”

                Text of Prime Minister’s Independence Day Address

 Following is the free rendering of the Prime Minister, Dr. 
Manmohan Singh’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Hindi 
on the occasion of the 61st Independence Day here today:-“My 
dear countrymen, brothers, sisters and dear childrenToday we celebrate the 60th anniversary of our Independence. 
My greetings to you all on this day of national celebration.Today we take special pride in saluting our beloved tricolor. Let 
us recall with pride the great sacrifice of our freedom fighters, whose undying 
love for India secured us our freedom. On this happy occasion join me in saluting the hard work of all our 
citizens who have, over these 60 years, helped build a new India. Let us bow our 
head in memory of all those brave jawans and all our brave citizens who have sacrificed 
their lives for the cause of our unity, integrity and progress.Sixty 
years ago the people of India began a new journey as a free nation, inspired by 
the message and vision of Mahatma Gandhi. But Gandhiji’s dream of a free India 
would only be fully realized when we banish poverty from our midst.            As I stand here and look at our tricolor fly high and fly 
majestically, my thoughts go to what I have said at these ramparts in the last 
three years. I have, over these three years, outlined a new vision of a caring 
India: An India that is united 
despite its many diversities.  An India that is not divided 
by caste, creed or gender. An India in which the creativity 
and enterprise of every citizen can find its full and free expression. An India in which the weak 
and downtrodden are empowered, the disabled find support, the destitute find succour 
and every individual is touched by the hand of progress and development.An India in which no person 
or region is left out of the journey of development and progress. An India in which every 
citizen can live a life of dignity, self- respect, decency and hope; where every 
citizen feels proud to say  - I am Indian!An India that lives in peace 
with all neighbours and all nations.An India that has regained 
its due place in the comity of nations.This 
vision of India is our proud inheritance from our national movement.  We are committed to fully realizing it. We 
have worked hard to translate this vision into reality, through legislative action, 
new programmes and new policies. Towards this end we have vastly increased fiscal 
support to social and human development.Today, 
when I look back, I can say with some satisfaction that we are undoubtedly moving 
forward in the right direction. We have been slow in taking some steps; we have 
dithered at times, and stumbled some times. We have had success on some fronts, 
and setbacks on some others. But, there is no doubt that we have been steadfast 
in our resolve, firm in our convictions and resolute in our commitment to the 
welfare of the common man (aam aadmi).We do feel a sense 
of satisfaction that on many fronts we have done well. Yet, we are aware that 
there is much more to be done.  We have 
moved forward in the many battles against poverty, ignorance and disease. But 
can we say we have won the war?  We have 
been able to step up the rate of growth. But can we say we are satisfied with 
the pace? Even after years of development and rising growth rates, why have we 
not been able to banish mass poverty and provide employment to all? Why do some 
regions of the country continue to lag behind? I ask these questions 
not to belittle our achievements, but to inspire us to greater effort. I ask not 
to make you feel dispirited, but to enthuse you to march forward. Since Independence, 
our development process has empowered our workers and farmers; it has made our 
citizens skilled and energetic; and, has made our business class dynamic. They 
are driving higher economic growth through their creativity and enterprise. Our 
economy is now growing at historically unprecedented rates. This enables us to 
generate the resources required for eradication of poverty, for education and 
health care for all. Poverty eradication 
is now a feasible goal.            How do we translate this goal into 
reality? We must understand that it is only through sustained economic growth 
and development that we can banish poverty from our midst. There is no magic wand. 
As creativity and enterprise blossom, new jobs are created and new incomes for 
new generations of working people. As incomes rise, so do government revenues that help finance the large 
increase in public expenditure that we need for poverty eradication, for universalisation 
of education and health care, for agriculture and irrigation, and for basic infrastructure. 
It is such investments that help eradicate poverty. Over the last three years, we have significantly increased public expenditure 
in the social sectors. This is in line with our commitment to the welfare of the 
aam aadmi. Central 
Government spending on education has been tripled. In health care, agriculture, 
irrigation and rural development it has more than doubled. This unprecedented expansion in social sector expenditure has enhanced 
the welfare of our people. Through the historic National Rural Employment Guarantee 
Act, we have made basic employment for 100 days a legal right. As a result the 
poorest of our poor are now assured of minimum household income. Today half the 
country is covered by the programme. We are committed to implementing it across 
the entire country. We are confident that this social safety net will fulfill 
Mahatma Gandhi’s dream of antyodaya - our humble attempt to wipe the tears 
of the poor.We have kept our focus on giving a new deal to rural India. We have doubled 
the supply of credit for farmers, reduced its cost and, where farmers have been 
in distress, we have written off interest and rescheduled loans.  We have helped increase farmers’ income by 
raising substantially the support price for wheat and rice. Through Bharat Nirman, 
we are investing in rural connectivity – road, electricity and telephone connectivity. 
Bharat Nirman is our effort at 
bridging the urban rural divide. This, I believe, is only a part of our total effort. There is more to be 
done and more will be done. In the coming years our main emphasis will be on agricultural 
development. We will soon launch a special programme to invest Rs 25,000 crore 
in agriculture, to enhance the livelihood of our farmers and increase food production. 
We will also focus on the needs of our farmers in dry and drought prone regions. 
I am touring a few states to personally review the agricultural situation across 
the country.Our growing economy and population need more foodgrains.  I am confident that as we roll out our ambitious 
agricultural development programme, we will see a boost in food grain production 
in all parts of the country, particularly in regions untouched by the first Green 
Revolution. Farmers are the backbone of our nation. Unless they prosper, the nation 
cannot prosper. I reassure our farmers that their welfare lie at the core of all 
our concerns. The transformation of rural India that we seek, and the progress we seek, 
are not possible unless we increase the productivity of our farms and the income 
of our farmers. But, given the large population dependent on farming and the small 
size of our farms, there are limits to how much income agriculture alone can generate. 
India cannot become a nation with islands of high growth and vast areas 
untouched by development. Where the benefits of growth accrue only to a 
few. This is good neither for our society nor for our polity.  Therefore, 
it is essential that we create new employment opportunities outside of agriculture.  
Remember, there is no developed country today anywhere in the world, that 
is not an industrial economy. Industrialization 
is critical for progress. If 
employment generation is the best weapon against poverty, then industrialization 
is the most effective means to create new job opportunities. In the past 60 years, 
many parts of our country have benefited from industrial development. In the next 
decade I want to see every region of the country to similarly benefit from the 
growth of modern industry. We will pursue policies that will help in our country’s 
rapid industrialization. It is true that the transition from an agrarian society to an industrial 
economy has always been a difficult one. But industrialization offers new opportunities 
and hope, especially for people in rural areas displaced by agrarian change. I 
agree that it is the responsibility of government to ensure that displacement 
does not lead to impoverishment; that those who lose land do not lose livelihoods; 
and, that those who have lost employment get better opportunities. We are, therefore, 
giving final shape to a National Policy for Rehabilitation and Resettlement for 
all those displaced by major projects. It is our societal obligation to ensure 
that the processes of development ensure that everyone is better off, and no one 
is worse off.            Industrialization would also mean urbanization. 
As more and more people live in urban areas, we need to have a more creative process 
of urbanization. This requires greater foresight in urban planning and development. 
Adequate compensation must be paid to those displaced and urban space must be 
used in an economical manner. We need to have adequate drainage facilities so 
that life in our cities does not come to a standstill during heavy rains. The 
day is not far off when half a billion people will be living in our cities and 
we need to prepare for that day.             Industrialization and urbanization 
will generate demand for first rate infrastructure. 
The expansion and modernisation of our highways, roads, railways and airports 
is visible proof of our efforts to meet this demand. Much more is needed and will 
be done. We need to do much more to generate and distribute more power, more 
efficiently. Everyone should get good quality power at affordable prices. I appeal 
to state governments to take this matter seriously as a weak power situation can 
become a handicap in industrialization and job-creation. For 
every one of our people to benefit from new employment opportunities being created 
across the economy, we must ensure that every Indian is educated and skilled. 
No nation can progress unless its people are educated. We have shown our 
Government’s commitment in this regard by tripling public spending on education 
in the last three years. I request states also to give priority to education, 
as education alone is the foundation on which a progressive, prosperous society 
can be built. Growing revenue earnings have improved the fiscal capacity of the 
States. They must now give priority to education. Towards 
this end, our Government has decided to invest in setting up good quality schools 
across the country. We will support 6,000 new high quality schools - one in every 
block of the country. Each such school will set standards of excellence for other 
schools in the area. As our primary education programmes achieve a degree of success, there 
is growing demand for secondary schools and colleges. We are committed to universalizing 
secondary education. An extensive programme for this is being finalized. We will also ensure that adequate numbers of colleges are set up across 
the country, especially in districts where enrolment levels are low. We will help 
States set up colleges in 370 such districts. The University system, which has been relatively neglected in recent years, 
is now the focus of our reform and development agenda. We will set up thirty new 
Central Universities. Every state that does not have a central university will 
now have one. In order to promote science and professional education, we are setting 
up five new Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, eight new Indian 
Institutes of Technology, seven new Indian Institutes of Management, and twenty 
new Indian Institutes of Information Technology. These will generate new educational 
opportunities for our youth. I am sure that, working together, we can ensure that 
at least a fifth of our children go to college as compared to one-tenth now. The vast majority of our youth seek skilled employment after schooling. 
Last year I spoke the need for a Vocational Education Mission. Such a Mission 
is ready to be launched. We will soon launch a Mission through which we will open 
1600 new industrial training institutes (ITIs) and polytechnics, 10,000 new vocational 
schools and 50,000 new Skill Development Centres. We will ensure that annually, 
over 100 lakh students get vocational training – which is a four-fold increase 
from today’s level. We will seek the active help of the private sector in this 
initiative so that they not only assist in the training but also lend a hand in 
providing employment opportunities.             We should seek not just functional literacy, but good quality education 
– education that is affordable, accessible, equitable – and available to every 
boy and girl who seeks to study. For the needy we will provide more scholarships.  
I wish to see a major revolution in the field of modern education in the 
next few years. It is my fervent desire that India becomes a fully educated, modern, 
progressive nation. From this historic Red Fort, I would like this message to 
go to every corner of India – we will make India a nation of educated people, 
of skilled people, of creative people.Democracy and development mean nothing for those 
who are not touched by the hand of progress. 
That is why, the architects of our Constitution placed special emphasis on the 
empowerment of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other weaker sections 
of society. In 60 years, we have seen many people climb the ladder of progress 
and social mobility. Yet,  we must admit 
that there are millions who still need our support and assistance. We are committed to the economic, social, political and educational empowerment of SCs, STs, OBCs and minorities. 
Apart from effective implementation of all existing reservations for them, we 
have announced major scholarship and development programmes for their benefit.  
I am happy to say that we have been able to persuade the private sector 
to some extent to take affirmative action to ensure that these 
sections of society get a fair share of employment in industry and trade. We have ensured that our tribal brethren get rights over land that they 
have cultivated for generations in forest areas. This should provide them a sense 
of security. The Prime Minister’s 15-Point Programme is designed to ensure that 
Minorities are not left out of development programmes and that they have the necessary 
resources to transform their lives.  I also affirm our commitment to the welfare and well being of people with 
disabilities of various kinds, as well as our senior citizens for whom all of 
us have a special place in our heart and mind. We have set up the National Commission 
for Protection of Child Rights to ensure that children are safe and well cared 
for. The problem of malnutrition is a matter of national shame. We have tried 
to address it by making the mid-day meal universal and massively expanding the 
anganwadi system. However, success requires sustained effort at the grassroots. 
Infants need to be breast-fed, have access to safe drinking water and health care. 
We need the active involvement of the community and panchayats to see that what 
we spend reaches our children. I appeal to the nation to resolve and work hard 
to eradicate malnutrition within five years.While 
we have moved ahead in the last three years on many fronts, there is one area 
where considerable work remains to be done. Millions of our fellow citizens are 
not engaged in any formal employment in the organized sector. They work in small 
establishments, run their own little shops or offer their services on a daily 
basis. They have neither a social safety net nor a sense of economic security. 
They become destitute or indebted when they fall ill or suffer accidents. We are 
committed to their welfare and are taking steps to provide this sense of security. 
We will provide an old age pension to all citizens above the age of 65 
and living below the poverty line. We will also provide life and disability cover 
to the heads of all poor families or to one earning member in each family so that 
they and their families can get over the consequences of injury or death. We are 
also working on a health insurance model so that our poor do not have to bear 
the high cost of medical care. These programmes will be launched shortly.There are many less developed regions in the country that must also benefit 
from development and economic growth. It is necessary to increase investment in 
backward areas to improve the regional balance in development. Towards this end, we have 
created the Backward Regions Grant Fund covering 250 districts. Over a period 
of time, these funds and our other initiatives will see that these regions catch 
up with other parts of the country.  Every 
State, every district, every village, every person must be touched by the hand 
of progress.  In 
the rush of modernization and the race to develop we must not forget the value 
of conserving our resources. Water is one such scarce resource. I want each and 
every citizen to pay special attention to water conservation and to how we store 
and use water. I 
urge states to look upon water as a national asset and work to resolve inter-state 
disputes over water sharing with an attitude of give and take. It is only through 
a cooperative approach that lasting solutions can be found to recurring problems, 
like floods and drought. We should work together to prevent the destruction caused 
by the ravages of nature, like floods.  In 
protecting our environment let us recall Mahatma Gandhi’s wise words that nature 
has given us enough for everyone’s need, but not for everyone’s greed. The Himalayas 
are part of our inheritance. Many of our rivers flow from them. We must protect 
our glaciers; we must keep our rivers clean and must increase our forest cover. 
Every citizen must ensure that our wildlife, especially endangered species like 
tigers, lions and elephants are preserved for the benefit of future generations. 
Keeping India green and clean should be a national and an individual obsession. 
Each 
one of us must be aware of how what we do impacts on nature and our climate. People 
across the world are increasingly concerned about global warming. And so must 
we be. We must be economical in our consumption of fuels and energy. This we owe 
humanity and to posterity. The 
land from which the message first went out that the whole world is one family 
(Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam) must set an example for the rest of the world in 
finding collective solutions to global problems. I also want our young people to actively associate themselves with a “National 
Campaign for Cleanliness” in our neighbourhoods, in public places and markets, 
in villages and slums. Let us all take that one extra step to ensure that we live 
in clean and healthy surroundings. Each one of us can make a difference by practicing 
what we preach. As Gandhiji used to say, we must be the change we want to see.            In implementing our strategy of inclusive 
growth, State Governments, Panchayati Raj Institutions and Urban Local Bodies 
have a crucial role to play. They must play an active role in mobilizing both 
resources and people for development. As Shri Rajiv Gandhi used to say, Panchayats 
must be actively associated with social development at the grassroots. They must 
ensure public participation in development programmes and proper functioning of 
our schools and hospitals. To make the government, at all levels, more accountable and more transparent, 
and to fight the cancer of corruption, we had introduced the Right to Information 
Act. I want every citizen to make full use of this act to ensure that government 
functions properly and honestly.In our quest for a caring, sharing and an inclusive society, we must develop 
the spirit of good neighbourliness with all people, irrespective of caste, creed 
or language. Our strength lies in our unity in diversity. Those who profess hatred 
and extremism, those who spread the virus of communalism and those who believe 
in violence and terrorism have no place in our society. We must all fight these 
anti-democratic, anti-social and anti-national forces, each in our own way, in 
our daily lives. Let there be no doubt in anyone’s mind that the Government is 
firm in its resolve to fight all forms of extremism and terrorism. We want to bring greater prosperity to the less developed regions of our 
country, especially the North-Eastern region and Jammu and Kashmir. This is our 
solemn commitment. Our State governments must be more active in creating an environment 
conducive to investment.We are investing in better infrastructure and connectivity in the North-eastern 
States. In Jammu & Kashmir, our long-term development plan is bringing new 
investment to all the three regions of the State.  Grassroots democracy has taken deep roots in 
the State and the Roundtable discussions 
have opened new avenues for reconciliation and development.Our greatest achievement over the past 60 years has been the fact that 
we have built the firm foundations of an open society and an open economy. As a multi-cultural, secular democracy and home to all the great religions of 
the world, we feel proud to be Indian. And the world has come to view this 
with regard. The success of a secular democracy in a nation of a billion people with 
such diversity is viewed with admiration the world over. This great idea of India 
as a symbol of unity in diversity is increasingly viewed with respect and regard. 
Our tolerance, our capacity to assimilate and our ability to reconcile the irreconcilable 
are objects of wonder. The world wants us to do well. Our challenges lie at home.India wants to have good relations with all the countries of the world. 
Big and small. Countries of the East and the West, the North and the South. Today, 
we enjoy good relations with all major powers and all developing countries. We 
have emerged as a bridge between the many extremes of the world. Our composite 
culture is living proof of the possibility of a confluence of civilizations. India 
will always be a nation bridging the many global divides. India wants to live in a neighbourhood of peace and prosperity. I assure 
all our neighbours that we in India want peace and the best of relations with 
all of them. I sincerely believe that in the prosperity and well-being of our 
neighbours lies the key to our own security and progress. We are a young nation. More importantly, we are a nation of young people. 
Once unleashed, the energy of our youth will drive India onto a new growth path. 
I assure you that for each one of you, and for our country, the best is yet to 
come.However, we must not be over-confident. We have a  very long march ahead. We need at least a decade 
of hard work and of sustained growth to realize our dreams. We have to bridge 
the many divides in our society and work with a unity of purpose. We need to think 
of the future and be steadfast in our resolve to march forward. We must capitalize 
the dynamism that pervades our people, our youth, our farmers, our businesses, 
We must have faith in our strength and confidence in our capabilities. 
Each of us have our individual identities. However, every citizen must recognize 
that we are Indians first and last. We fritter away our time on petty issues and 
pointless personal differences. I urge all political parties, all political and 
social leaders to resist the temptation to divide people along narrow, sectarian 
lines. Our strength is in our unity, despite our diversity. It is that unity which 
gave us our Independence. It is that unity that gives us our strength as a nation. 
This was the dream of our founding fathers. This was the vision of our 
Constitution. We should not move away from this vision, and must face the future 
with courage. However, as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru said from these ramparts nearly 
sixty years ago, “laws and constitutions do not by themselves make a country great. 
It is the enthusiasm, energy and constant effort of a people that make it a great 
nation.” Let 
us all come together and work resolutely for the welfare of our people and for 
the development of our nation.Jai Hind!”****NSK/SH/LV/CS/SKS(Release ID :29937)

                PM’s address on 62nd Independence Day

The 
    Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, addressed the Nation from the ramparts 
    of the Red Fort today. Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that 
    it has been the sincere endeavour of our Government to keep each of our promises.  
    “We have given a new deal to rural India”, 
    the Prime Minister said.  Dr. Singh 
    spoke about several initiatives launched for the inclusive economic growth 
    of the country.  Highlighting various 
    steps taken for the growth of agricultural sector, the Prime Minister said 
    that we have increased the bank credit for the sector from Rs.81,000 crore 
    to Rs.2,25,000 crore during the past four years.  
    “Our farms are once again green. Our godowns are once again filling 
    up. Our farmers are once again hopeful about their future and their welfare,” 
    he added.
Dr. 
    Manmohan Singh took the opportunity to point out that the Government has taken 
    important initiatives on the ‘Seven Sutras’, a term coined by him four years 
    ago, as priorities namely, agriculture, water, education, health care, employment, 
    urban renewal and infrastructure. The Prime Minister emphasized that “India 
    will be transformed only when every Indian is literate, well fed, healthy 
    and can secure gainful employment.”  
The 
    Prime Minister further stressed that his Government has been paying special 
    attention to the development of education in the country.  He said “we are establishing 6000 new high quality 
    model schools, with at least one school in each block.” As many as 373 new 
    colleges are being opened in backward districts besides 30 new universities, 
    8 new IITs, 7 new IIMs, 20 new IIITs, 5 new Indian Institutes of Science, 
    2 Schools of Planning and Architecture, 10 NITs, and a 1000 new polytechnics.
Wanting to see a modern India imbued by a scientific temper, 
    the Prime Minister said “this year, we hope to send an Indian Spacecraft, 
    Chandrayan, to the moon. It will be an important milestone in the development 
    of our space programme.”  
Promising to continue striving for the development and 
    prosperity of the country, Dr. Singh assured “We will work hard to take the 
    country to greater heights in all fields.”
Stating that Government has taken special measures to 
    insulate poorer sections from the impact of rising food and fuel prices, the 
    Prime Minister said, “We are taking determined measures to bring prices under 
    reasonable control.”  Underlining the 
    need for atomic energy, the Prime Minister said that the nuclear agreement 
    being negotiated with developed countries will not only end India’s nuclear 
    isolation, but also enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of 
    farmers, artisans, traders and industry. The Prime Minister mentioned in his 
    speech that recommendation of Sixth Pay Commission is a step in making Government 
    more efficient. 
Stressing upon the Government’s resolve to meet the challenge 
    of terrorism, the Prime Minister urged upon the State Governments, all political 
    parties, civil society groups and social and religious leaders to cooperate 
    in rooting out terrorism from the country.  Initiatives being taken to promote peace and 
    stability in the North Eastern region and J&K will be taken forward, the 
    Prime Minister said. Referring to the issue of providing the best facilities 
    to the pilgrims of Shri Amarnath Shrine, Dr. Singh said that it can only be 
    resolved in an atmosphere of peace and goodwill.  He appealed to the people of Jammu & Kashmir 
    to cooperate in establishing peace in the State.
Calling 
    for defeating the terrorism, the Prime Minister emphasized that the terrorists 
    and those who support them are enemies of the people of India and Pakistan and of peace in the region 
    and the world. “If this issue of terrorism is not addressed, all the good 
    intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will 
    be negated”, he added.
            “Let 
    us resolve today to stand together, to strengthen the unity and integrity 
    of our country and to stand firm in our determination to build a new India 
    of our dreams,” the Prime Minister concluded.   
    
Following is the 
    text of the Prime Minister’s address on the occasion: 
“My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters and my dear children,                                                        
Greetings to all of you 
    on this happy occasion of our Independence Day. 
This is a sacred day for 
    every Indian. 
Today we remember the sacrifice 
    of those who under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi fought for our freedom 
    from foreign rule. 
Today we remember the hard 
    work and dedication of all those who have toiled to build a free and modern 
    India. And we re-dedicate ourselves to that cause.
We remember our farmers, 
    our workers and our teachers. We remember our soldiers - who defend our borders 
    in snowy mountains, in deserts, in jungles, on the shores and in the oceans.
Brothers 
    and Sisters,
Four 
    years ago, on this day, I stood here before you and spoke to you about our 
    Government’s new vision for a new India.
I 
    said to you that it is our desire to build an India that is just and humane; 
    
an 
    India that treats all its citizens as equals; 
an 
    India that is prosperous; 
an 
    India that lives in peace; 
an 
    India in which everyone can find work suited to his or her talent and can 
    work for his or her brighter future.
An 
    India that is secular, that is fair and just to all its people. An India united 
    in its diversity. 
It 
    has been our sincere endeavour to work for the building of such an India.
Brothers 
    and Sisters,
Four 
    years ago I stood here and said to you that I have no promises to make, but 
    I have promises to keep. 
The 
    implementation of the National Common Minimum Programme,  was our promise to keep;
To 
    give a “new deal to rural India”, was our promise to keep; 
To 
    make our economy and society inclusive was our promise to keep;
To 
    take India to its rightful place in the comity of nations, was our promise 
    to keep;
It 
    has been the sincere endeavour of our Government to keep each of these promises. 
    
We 
    have given a new deal to rural India.
Through 
    the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana we are investing Rs. 25000 crore 
    in agriculture;                                                            
    
To 
    provide relief to our debt distressed farmers we have waived loans taken from 
    the banks amounting to about Rs. 71000 crore;
In 
    the past four years we have increased bank credit for agricultural sector 
    from Rs 81000 crore to Rs 225000 crore, and have reduced the interest rates 
    for farm loans;
In 
    order to improve the economic conditions of farmers we have steeply increased 
    the procurement prices for food grains; 50% for wheat and 30% for paddy;
The 
    National Food Security Mission has been set up to enhance production 
    of rice, wheat and pulses;
Irrigation, 
    watershed development, rain fed areas development, and flood management have 
    received our special attention; 
Our 
    effort at increasing investment in rural areas and reducing the debt burden 
    of farmers has turned our agricultural economy around. 
After 
    almost a decade of stagnation especially from 1998 to 2004, investment in 
    agriculture is increasing and there has been a revival in this area.  We have had record production of foodgrains, 
    cotton and sugar in 2007-08. 
Our 
    farms are once again green. Our godowns are once again filling up. Our farmers 
    are once again hopeful about their future and their welfare.
Brothers 
    and Sisters, 
I 
    spent the first ten years of my life in a village that had no electricity, 
    no drinking water supply, no doctor, no roads and no phones.  I had to walk many miles to a school. I had 
    to study at night in the dim light of a kerosene lamp. After independence 
    there has been considerable development in rural areas, yet many of our citizens 
    still live a life that I lived in my childhood. 
That 
    is why when our Government took over, we launched Bharat Nirman, to 
    build rural infrastructure.  Our Government 
    is committed to transforming rural India. In these four years we have taken 
    important initiatives.  I am confident 
    that a new and prosperous India will be built due to our efforts. 
My 
    dear Countrymen, 
Four 
    years ago I spoke to you about our “Seven Sutras” – the seven priorities 
    for our Government – agriculture, water, education, health care, employment, 
    urban renewal and infrastructure.
In 
    each area we have taken important initiatives. I have already spoken about 
    our initiatives for agricultural development and farmer’s welfare.
The 
    second important area of development has been infrastructure development. 
    There is a new dynamism in our railways. New roads are being built. New seaports 
    and airports are being developed. 
More 
    and more of our people now live in our cities. The Jawaharlal Nehru National 
    Urban Mission has been funding urban development and modernization of 
    our cities.  
The 
    National Rural Health Mission has been expanding public health facilities 
    and services in rural areas.  
As 
    someone who started his professional life as a teacher, I feel proud to say 
    that our Government has been giving special attention to the development of 
    education in our country. There is a massive increase in public investment 
    in education at all levels. In elementary education, in secondary education 
    and in higher education. 
We 
    have strengthened Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and expanded the mid-day 
    meal programme upto upper primary level in all districts of the country.  About 14 crore children are being provided mid-day 
    meals under this scheme.
We are establishing 6000 
    new high quality model schools, with at least one school in each block. 373 
    new colleges are being opened in backward districts. We are opening 30 new universities, 
    8 new IITs, 7 new IIMs, 20 new IIITs, 5 new Indian Institutes of Science, 
    2 Schools of Planning and Architecture, 10 NITs, and a 1000 new polytechnics.
I
have called the 11th Five Year Plan our “National Education Plan”.
We want every section of our society to get access to education. Every child
belonging to a family of SC, ST, OBC and all Minorities, every single child,
boy or girl, must have access to modern education.
 
Our Government is implementing several new scholarship schemes 
    for the educational development of our children. Schemes for pre-matric and 
    post-matric scholarships for children hailing from SC, ST, OBC and Minority 
    families are being implemented. Special scholarships for meritorious students 
    from SC, ST, OBC and Minority families have also been launched. Scholarships 
    for overseas studies are being given to SC and ST students. National merit-cum-means 
    scholarships for children hailing from economically weakers sections and children 
    with disabilities have also been approved.
We have established a new Skill Development Mission which will work under 
    the supervision of the Prime Minister. A Skill Development Corporation will 
    be created by the Government with the active participation of the private 
    sector to give special training to our young men and women, our workers and 
    our technicians. 
I am happy to say that we are sincerely implementing most 
    of the recommendations of the Justice Sachar Committee Report on social, economic 
    and educational empowerment of our Muslim community.
India will be transformed 
    only when every Indian is literate, well fed, healthy and can secure gainful 
    employment. 
I 
    want to see a modern India, imbued by a scientific temper, where the benefits 
    of modern knowledge flow to all sections of society. This year we hope to 
    send an Indian space craft, Chandrayan, to the moon. It will be an 
    important milestone in the development of our space programme. 
Brothers 
    and Sisters, 
Providing 
    employment has been a special priority for us. Our policies for agriculture, 
    for industry, for infrastructure development and for skill development, will 
    all promote employment. 
Our 
    beloved former Prime Minister Shrimati Indira Gandhi had said, “Garibi Hatao”. 
    Our leader Shrimati Sonia Gandhi has given us the slogan, “Rozgar Badhao”. 
    Our Government is making special efforts to create  
    “rozgar” to fight “garibi”.
The
National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme is a historic initiative
of our Government. Today the entire country is covered by this programme. The
NREGA is providing minimum livelihood support to the crores of neediest among
us. It is aimed to soften the sharp edges of poverty.
To create more employment we need more investment in
agriculture, in manufacturing and in infrastructure. We need a new wave of
industrialization to generate more employment. If industrial development has
any adverse impact on some of our rural folk, we will ensure that there is
reasonable compensation and proper rehabilitation. A new Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Policy has been formulated and we will seek Parliament’s
approval for it.  
We have introduced a bill in Parliament to provide social
security to the workers of the unorganized sector.  Our Government has launched the Aam Aadmi
Beema Yojana, under which one member of each landless family in rural areas
will be insured.  We have also started a
programme to provide health insurance to Below Poverty Line families of workers
in the unorganized sector.  Citizens
above 65 years of age, living below the poverty line are being covered under the
Indira Gandhi Pension Scheme.
My 
    dear countrymen,
In 
    the past four years we have seen a sharp increase in the rate of investment. 
    This has contributed to an increase in the rate of growth of the economy. 
     
For 
    the first time in history, we have had four years of nearly 9.0% economic 
    growth. India is among the world’s fastest growing economies. 
But 
    there are new challenges that we face. We have the challenge of inflation. 
    I know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices. 
    The inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors. 
    All over the world and in global markets the price of food, fuel and other 
    commodities has been rising. In many developing countries the rate of inflation 
    is double that in India.
Our 
    Government has worked hard to ensure that in India the rate of inflation is 
    not as high as in many other countries. We have also taken special measures 
    to insulate the poorer sections of our society from the full impact of rising 
    food and fuel prices. Our Government has not raised the price of kerosene 
    and fertilizers. We have not raised the issue price of wheat and rice under 
    PDS. 
We are taking determined 
    measures to bring prices under reasonable control.  I have urged all Chief Ministers to improve 
    and strengthen the PDS to ensure availability of essential commodities to 
    the common man at reasonable prices.  The 
    Reserve Bank of India is moderating the growth of money supply in the country 
    so that inflation can be controlled.  However, 
    while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything which hurts our 
    growth.
Brothers 
    and Sisters, 
Today, 
    while speaking about the achievements of our Government, I wish to make one 
    more promise.  We have done much, but 
    I realize that there is more to do.  The 
    problem of malnutrition is a curse that we must remove. Our efforts to provide 
    every child with access to education and to improve health care services for 
    all citizens will continue.  We need 
    to take forward our initiatives for giving equal status to women and for their 
    social and economic empowerment. I promise to you that we will continue striving 
    for the development and prosperity of our country.  We will work hard to take the country to greater 
    heights in all fields.
Brothers 
    and Sisters,
We
must apply modern science and technology to find long term solutions to our energy
problem. Our crude oil and gas reserves are limited. We must find
alternative energy sources. I would like our scientists and engineers to find
ways in which we can make better use of solar energy, wind energy, bio-gas and
other sources of energy. 
Our economy must grow at the rate of at least ten per cent
every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all. A basic
requirement for sustained growth, and for the development of our agriculture
and industry is availability of energy, particularly electricity.    
All over the world, there is growing realization of the
importance of atomic energy to meet the challenge of energy security and
climate change.  It is a clean,
environmental friendly and renewable source of energy.  
India’s atomic scientists and technologists are world class.
They have developed nuclear energy capacities despite heavy odds. But there are
handicaps which have adversely affected our atomic energy programme.  We have inadequate production of uranium.  The quality of our uranium resources is not
comparable to those of other producers. 
Many countries have imposed sanctions on trade with India in nuclear
materials, nuclear equipment and nuclear technology. As a result, our nuclear
energy programme has suffered. 
The nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed 
    countries will end India’s nuclear isolation. It will open up new opportunities 
    for trade in dual-use high technologies and nuclear materials and equipment, 
    opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialization of our country.  
    It will enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of our farmers, 
    our artisans, our traders and our industry.
Brothers 
    and Sisters,
Four 
    years ago I said to you that an important challenge we face is the challenge 
    of providing good governance. We have taken several steps to make Government 
    transparent, efficient and responsive. The Right to Information Act 
    was one major step. We have initiated reform and modernization of Government. 
    The National e-Governance Plan will make it easier for all our citizens 
    to deal with the various agencies of Government.
We 
    have completed the examination of the report of the Sixth Pay Commission. 
    We have gone beyond the recommendations of the Commission in increasing emoluments 
    of government employees.  While doing 
    this we have taken special care of the interests and welfare of our armed 
    forces and para-military forces, and government employees working at lower 
    levels in our civil services.  This 
    is one more step in making Government more efficient. 
We 
    need more reforms at all levels of Government.  
    We want to improve our schools, our hospitals and other public services.  
    The Panchayati Raj Institutions have an important role to play in decentralization 
    and reform of Government.  We must enhance 
    their administrative and financial powers.  
    I appeal to State Governments to take all possible steps for improving 
    governance and to help in the Central Government’s initiatives.
My 
    dear Countrymen,
Terrorism, 
    extremism, communalism and fundamentalism have emerged as major challenges 
    to the unity and integrity of our country.  
    The recent terrorist attacks in Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Jaipur and other 
    parts of the country have shocked the nation.  
    What words can I find to condemn such acts of barbarism.  I share the sorrow and grief of people affected 
    by terrorism.  The Government of India 
    will take concrete steps to rehabilitate and help such families.  
I 
    commend our security forces and intelligence agencies for the dedication with 
    which they are dealing with the problem under difficult circumstances.   But I agree that we have to further strengthen 
    our intelligence agencies and police forces to deal with the problem of terrorism.
We 
    will examine the functioning of our intelligence agencies and police and security 
    forces and take all possible steps to equip them to tackle this challenge.  
    Whatever resources are required, will be provided.  
    Whatever manpower is required will be provided.  
    We are firm in our resolve to meet the challenge of terrorism.
I 
    urge the State Governments, all political parties, civil society groups and 
    social and religious leaders to cooperate with us in rooting out terrorism 
    from our country.
Brothers 
    and Sisters,
I 
    am confident that we will overcome these challenges.  But this requires hard work and unity of purpose.  
    This requires a politics of consensus, not confrontation.  
    This requires dialogue among communities, not discord.
The 
    challenge of communalism, of extremism and of terrorism cannot be won by a 
    nation divided.  
The 
    challenge of environmental and ecological destruction cannot be won by a society 
    divided.
The 
    challenge of economic modernization and social development of all, of Scheduled 
    Castes and Scheduled Tribes, of Other Backward Classes and Minorities, cannot 
    be won by a people divided.
Brothers 
    and Sisters,
I 
    have said on a number of occasions that I am greatly concerned about the problem 
    of regional imbalances in development. Some parts of our country are doing 
    much better than others.  Some States 
    are being left behind. This pattern has persisted for far too long. We must 
    ensure that the less developed States catch up with the developed ones. 
We 
    must pay special attention to the development of the North-Eastern region. 
    Our Government has taken several initiatives to increase public investment 
    in the North-East and in Jammu & Kashmir. We are investing in infrastructure 
    and in education in these regions to encourage development and generate employment. 
    
Jammu 
    & Kashmir and the North-eastern region require an era of peace for them 
    to catch up with the more developed parts of the country. We have been taking 
    various initiatives to promote peace and stability in these States. These 
    initiatives will be taken forward.
The 
    recent incidents in the State of Jammu and Kashmir are a cause for concern.  
    In this hour of crisis, divisive politics will lead us nowhere.  
    I appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of 
    Jammu and Kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to 
    the problems of the State. 
The 
    sacred shrine of Shri Amar Nath inspires all Indians to march together.  This shrine is a shining example of our secular 
    tradition, where Hindu pilgrims have been looked after for years by their 
    Muslim brothers.  Issues related to 
    this sacred place, especially the issue of providing the best possible facilities 
    to pilgrims, can only be resolved in an atmosphere of peace and goodwill.  
    Dividing people in the name of religion can complicate these issues 
    further which can also pose a threat to the unity and integrity of the country.  
    I appeal to the people of Jammu and Kashmir to cooperate with us in 
    establishing peace in the State.  It 
    is my conviction that all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and 
    peaceful means.
Brothers 
    and Sisters,
Our 
    ancient Himalayas are under environmental threat. If the Himalayan glaciers 
    recede, the flow of water in our sacred rivers will go down. Climate change 
    can disrupt our economy in several ways. Some of our coastal areas could be 
    submerged. Our monsoon pattern may change. We need long term solutions to 
    such threats. A national consensus is also required for the Government to 
    evolve effective policies to deal with these problems.
Our 
    Government has come forward with a National Action Plan on Climate Change. 
    This plan shows how each of us must adapt our ways of working and living and 
    how we must treat our natural resources, so that our carbon emissions remain 
    within reasonable limits and our environment is protected. 
My 
    fellow countrymen,
Our 
    goal in South Asia is to seek a peaceful, stable and prosperous neighbourhood.  
    We seek to accelerate the pace of social and economic development in 
    our country and our region, while safeguarding our national security.  
    Our foreign policy has been based on these principles.
We 
    wish all our neighbours well.  We welcome 
    the strengthening of democratic forces in our neighbourhood, especially in 
    Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan.  The recent 
    blasts in our Embassy in Kabul have cast a shadow over our efforts to normalize 
    relations with Pakistan and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our 
    region.  I have personally conveyed 
    my concern and disappointment to the Government of Pakistan.  
If this issue of terrorism is not addressed, all the 
    good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony 
    will be negated.  We will not be able 
    to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take. The terrorists and those 
    who support them are enemies of the people of India and Pakistan, of friendship 
    between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world.  We must defeat them.
In the last year we have strengthened our relations with 
    the major powers, Latin American countries, Arab countries and African countries.  
    We will continue our efforts in this direction, keeping in view our 
    national interests.
India is today viewed with respect as one of the world’s 
    fastest growing economies.  People of 
    Indian Origin are engaged in diverse activities around the world and their 
    capabilities are recognized the world over.  Their achievements inspire us.  The world today expects India to regain its 
    due place in the comity of nations.  This 
    is a moment of opportunity for us.
We are rapidly marching forward to regain our rightful 
    place in the comity of nations.  But 
    to reach that goal we have a lot of work to do at home. We have to overcome 
    each of the challenges I have spoken about. We have to forge a greater unity 
    of purpose between various political parties, between different communities, 
    between all sections of our society, rich and poor.
We have to manage our natural and financial resources 
    more prudently.  We have an obligation 
    to our future generations. We cannot think only for ourselves. We cannot think 
    only about survival from day to day, from year to year and from one election 
    to another. We have to think about the welfare and well-being of our children 
    and grandchildren, their grandchildren and future generations.
If we resolve to work together as a nation, and work 
    hard and with commitment to the welfare of all our people, there is nothing 
    that we cannot do.
Let us resolve today to stand together, to strengthen 
    the unity and integrity of our country and to stand firm in our determination 
    to build a new India of our dreams.   
My dear children, please join me in saying Jai Hind 
Jai Hind
Jai Hind
Jai Hind.”

                PM’s Independence Day Address

                Following is the text of the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh’s address from the ramparts of Red Fort on the occasion of Independence Day: 

“Dear countrymen, brothers and sisters,


	I consider myself fortunate to once again have the opportunity to address you on this sacred day of 15th August.  On this auspicious occasion, I extend my hearty greetings to all of you.


.	Today is most certainly a day of happiness and pride for us.  We are proud of our freedom.  We are proud of our democracy.  We are proud of our values and ideals.  But we should also remember that it has taken the sacrifices of lakhs of Indians to bring us where we are today.  Our well being and progress have been built upon the foundation of the hard work and sacrifices of our freedom fighters, the brave jawans of our armed forces, our farmers, our workers and our scientists.


	Today, we remember all those martyrs who laid down their lives for the freedom and security of our country.  The best way of paying homage to those brave sons of our country will be to resolve today that we will always stay committed to strengthening the unity and integrity of our  nation.  Let us all together take a vow that we will spare no effort to take India to greater heights.


	The elections held a few months back have strengthened our nation and our democracy.  In these elections, the people of India have favoured a politics that integrates our country and our society.  You have chosen a political arrangement which is secular and which includes many varied strands of thought.  You have voted for a democratic way of life which provides for resolution of differences through debate and discussion.  I am of the view that we have received a mandate for starting a new era of cooperation and harmony in our national life.


	We accept with humility the great responsibility you have entrusted to us.  I wish to assure you on this sacred day that we will work with sincerity and dedication to fulfil the expectation of each and every citizen of India.  It will be our effort to ensure that every citizen of India is prosperous and secure and is able to lead a life of dignity and self respect.  We will derive inspiration in our work from the ideals of service and sacrifice bequeathed to us by the father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi.  Our Government will follow the path shown by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Shrimati Indira Gandhi, Shri Rajiv Gandhi and other great leaders of our country.  It will be our endeavour to carry everyone with us and to lead the country ahead on the path of development by creating an environment of consensus and cooperation.


	We know that India's progress can be real only when every citizen of our country benefits from it.  Every Indian has a right over our national resources.  The policies and schemes of our Government in the last 5 years have been based on this paradigm.  It has been our endeavour to ensure that the benefit of development reaches all sections of the society and all regions and citizens of the country.  Our efforts have succeeded to some extent. But our work is still incomplete.  We will carry it forward with firm determination and sincerity.


	As you know, our economy grew at a rate of about 9% from the year 2004-05 to the year 2007-08.  This growth rate  came down to 6.7% in 2008-09 due to the global economic crisis.  It is only a result of our policies that the global crisis has affected us to a lesser extent than many other countries.  Restoring our growth rate to 9% is the greatest challenge we face.  We will make every necessary effort to meet this challenge¬¬¬ -- whether it is for increasing capital flows into the country, or for encouraging exports or for increasing public investment and expenditure.  We expect that there will be an improvement in the situation by the end of this year, but till that time we will all have to bear with the fall out of the global economic slow down.  I appeal to all businessmen and industrialists to join us in our effort to tackle this difficult situation and to fulfill their social obligations fully.


	I have always believed that India's prosperity is not possible without the prosperity of our farmers.  This is the reason why our Government had waived bank loans of lakhs of farmers.  We have increased the support prices for agricultural products by far more than ever before.  This year there has been deficiency in the monsoons.  This would definitely have some adverse impact on our crops.  But, I am sure we will be able to meet the situation quite well.  We will provide all possible assistance to our farmers to deal with the drought.   In view of the deficiency in the monsoons, we have postponed the date for repayment of bank loans of our farmers.  We are also giving additional support to farmers for payment of interest on short term crop loans. 


	We have adequate stocks of foodgrains.  All efforts will be made to control the rising prices of foodgrains, pulses and other goods of daily use.  I appeal to all State governments to exercise their statutory powers to prevent hoarding and black marketing of essential commodities.  


	We will have to adopt modern means to be successful in agriculture.  We will have to make more efficient use of our scarce land and water resources.  Our scientists must devise new techniques to increase the productivity of our small and marginal farmers.   More attention will have to be paid to the needs of those farmers who do not have means for irrigation.  The country needs another Green Revolution and we will try our best to make it possible.  Our goal is 4% annual growth in agriculture and I am confident that we will be able to achieve this target in the next 5 years.


It is our ardent desire that not even a single citizen of India should ever go hungry.  This is the reason why we have promised a food security law under which every family living below the poverty line will get a fixed amount of foodgrains every month at concessional rates.  It is also our national resolve to root out malnutrition from our country.  In this effort, special care will be taken of the needs of women and children.  We will endeavour to extend the benefit of ICDS to every child below the age of six years in the country by March 2012.


The first UPA government had given the right to 100 days of employment  in a year to every rural family through the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.  In the last 4 years, this programme has been expanded to cover the whole country.  The programme has been able to fulfil the expectations from it to a large extent.  In the year 2008-09, it benefited about 4 crore families.  It has also contributed to improvement in rural infrastructure.  In the coming days we will improve the programme to bring more transparency and accountability into it.  New types of works will be added to the works that can be taken up under the programme.


We know that good education is not only desirable in itself but is also essential for the empowerment of our people.  We have recently enacted the Right to Education Act.  This law provides to each child of our country the right to elementary education.  I wish to make it clear that funds will not be a constraint as far as education is concerned.  We will give special attention to the needs of disabled children.  As a result of our efforts in the last few years, almost every child in our country has access to primary education today.  Now we also need to pay greater attention to secondary education.  Secondary education will be expanded through a programme that will ensure that every child in the country gets its benefit.  We will endeavour to provide bank loans and scholarships to the maximum possible number of students to support their education. 


A new scheme will be started to help students from economically weaker sections of society by way of reduced interest rate on their education loans.  This will benefit about 5 lakh students in getting technical and professional education.


Good health is one of our basic needs.  The National Rural Health Mission that we have started aims at strengthening the infrastructure for rural public health services.  We will expand the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana so as to cover each family below the poverty line.  In our journey on the road of development we will pay special attention to the needs of our differently abled brothers and sisters.  We will increase facilities available for them. 


While touching upon issues related to health, I would also like to make a mention of the flu that is spreading due to the H1N1 virus.  As you all know, some parts of our country have been affected by this illness.  The Central Government and the State Governments will together continue to make all necessary efforts to control the spread of this infection.  I also want to assure you that the situation does not warrant a disruption of our daily lives because of fear and anxiety.


The special programmes that our government had started for the development of rural and urban areas will be accelerated.  We have been successful to some extent in improving the infrastructure in rural areas through Bharat Nirman.  But  there is still a wide disparity between the development of rural and urban areas.  To this end, the allocations under Bharat Nirman have been increased substantially this year.  We will set more ambitious targets for schemes for house construction and telecommunications in rural areas. 


We will accelerate our efforts to improve physical infrastructure in the country.  The Road Transport and National Highways Department has initiated action for construction of 20 Km of National Highways every day.  Similarly, Railways have started work on the Dedicated Freight Corridors.  We are giving careful attention to the problems of Air India and will resolve them soon.  The schemes of roads, railways and civil aviation being implemented in Jammu & Kashmir and the States of the North East will be especially monitored. 


We had started the Jawaharalal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission for the urban areas.  We will accelerate this programme also.  Today, lakhs of our citizens live in slums which lack basic amenities.  We wish to make our country slum free as early as possible.  In the next five years, we will provide better housing facilities to slum dwellers through a new scheme, Rajiv Awas Yojana. 


Climate change has become an issue of global concern in recent years.  If we don't take the necessary steps in time, our glaciers will melt and our rivers will go dry. The problems of droughts and floods will grow in seriousness. We also need to prevent air pollution.  India wishes to tackle the problem of climate change in partnership with other countries of the world.  We have taken a decision to constitute 8 National Missions.  We are committed to meet the challenge of climate change through these 8 Missions.  To increase the use of solar energy and to make it affordable, we will launch the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission on 14th November of this year.


The sacred Ganga is the life source for crores of Indians.  It is our duty to keep the river clean.  We have constituted the National Ganga Authority in which the Central and State Governments will jointly work towards this end.  The cooperation of the public is also needed in this effort.  


Our natural resources are limited.  We must use them more efficiently.  We need a new culture of energy conservation.  We also need to prevent the misuse of water.  We will pay more attention to programmes for water collection and storage.  ""Save Water"" should be one of our national slogans. 


If we work united, we can meet all challenges that confront us. Our citizens have the right to express dissent and anger.  I also maintain that every government should be sensitive to people's complaints and dissatisfaction.  But nothing is achieved by destroying public property and indulging in violence against one's fellow citizens.  Our democracy has no place for those who resort to violence to express their disagreement, and the government will deal firmly with such people.


Terrorism has emerged as a threat to peace and harmony in all parts of the world.  After the horrific terror attacks in Mumbai in last November, our government has taken many steps against terrorism.  To root out terrorist activities, our security forces and intelligence agencies are being constantly upgraded.  I am sure that with cooperation  from all sections of our society, we will be successful in eliminating terrorism from our country.  


Some parts of our country continue to be affected by the Naxalite menace.  It is the constitutional obligation of the government to protect the life and liberty of our citizens.  Those who think that they can seize power by recourse to the gun do not understand the strength of our democracy.  The Central Government will redouble its efforts to deal with Naxalite activities.  We will extend all help to the State Governments to make their police forces more effective.  Central forces will be provided wherever they are needed.  We will also do more to ensure better coordination among States. 


I would also like to state here that we will endeavour to remove those causes of social and economic dissatisfaction which give rise to problems like Naxalism.  We believe in a development process which will remove backwardness,  unemployment and reduce disparities in income and wealth. We seek active partnership of our brothers and sisters of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in our development processes. 


We do not subscribe to the view that to take special care of the deprived sections of the society amounts to appeasement.  In fact, we believe that it is our solemn duty to do so.  Our government will give its full attention to the well being of our brothers and sisters belonging to the minority communities.  We have started many schemes for the welfare of the minorities.  These programmes will be taken forward.  The funds for the special schemes taken up for the development of minority concentration districts have been enhanced quite substantially this year.  Similarly, we have allocated increased funds for scholarship schemes for minorities that the first UPA government had started.  A Bill to prevent communal violence has been introduced in Parliament and efforts will be made to convert it into a law as soon as possible. 


The practice of female foeticide regrettably persists in our society.  This is a shame for all of us.  We must eliminate it as early as possible.  Our progress will be incomplete till women become equal partners in all areas of our life and in our nation's progress.   Our government is committed to the early passage of the Women's Reservation Bill.  This legislation will provide one-third reservation for women in Parliament and the State Assemblies.  We are also working on a legislation to provide 50% reservation for women in rural and urban local bodies. In fact, we should find ways and means to increase the participation of women in all democratic institutions.  Our government will make sustained efforts for social and economic empowerment of women.  We have decided to launch a National Female Literacy Mission, through which female illiteracy will be reduced by half in the next three years.


We are proud of our brave soldiers.  It is our duty to ensure that ex-servicemen are able to lead a life of comfort.  We have accepted the recommendations of the committee constituted to examine the issue of pension of ex-servicemen.  This will lead to increased pension for about 12 lakh retired jawans and Junior Commissioned Officers. 


In our journey of development, we should not only pay special attention to some sections of our society, but must also take care of the special needs of the  backward regions of our country. We will redouble our efforts to remove regional imbalances in the level of development.  Here I would like to make a special mention of our States of the North-East.  Our government will constantly endeavour to make the States of the North East equal partners in the country's progress.  Imphal or Kohima may be physically far away from Delhi, but the welfare of our brothers and sisters of the North East is always close to our heart.  We know that without their well-being the country cannot move forward.


There have been two elections in Jammu & Kashmir since I addressed you on the last Independence Day.  The first one was for the State Legislative Assembly and the second for the Lok Sabha.  People of all areas of the State have participated vigorously in both the elections.  This is a proof that there is no place for separatist thought in Jammu & Kashmir. 


Our Government will continue assisting the State Government in improving governance in all parts of Jammu & Kashmir.  It will be our endeavour to ensure that human rights are respected in the State and all its citizens are able to lead a life of peace and dignity in an environment of safety and security.  We respect the special assurances and concessions provided to Jammu & Kashmir in our Constitution.  We will continue to honour  these special provisions. 


Today's world is becoming smaller in many respects.  Whether it is the international economic crisis or terrorism or climate change - what happens in one part of the world has an effect on other parts also.  The international economic and political order is changing.  Questions are being raised on the functioning and continued effectiveness of the multilateral institutions established in the 20th Century. 


Our foreign policy should be able to cater to India's interests in these constantly changing circumstances.  I am happy that we have been successful in doing this to a large extent. 


We have good relations with the United States, Russia, China, Japan and Europe.  There is a tremendous amount of goodwill for India and its people in the countries of South East Asia, Central Asia, West Asia and the Gulf.  We have further strengthened our traditional ties with Africa.  We are looking for new opportunities in Latin America. 


As far our neighbours are concerned, we want to live with them in peace and harmony.  We will make every possible effort to create an environment conducive to the social and economic development of the whole of South Asia. 


However good our programmes and schemes might be, their benefit will not reach the public till the government machinery is not free of corruption and till it is not effective in their implementation. I would like our public administration to be more efficient so that programmes for public good can be implemented faster. We need to improve our delivery systems to provide basic services to our citizens. We will act with speed on the recommendations of the Administrative Reforms Commission to strengthen governance. Renewed efforts will be made to decentralize public administration through the Panchayati Raj Institutions and to ensure greater involvement of people in it. Initiative will be taken for a new partnership between the civil society and the government so that tax payers' money is better spent. We have enacted the Right to Information Act to enhance accountability and transparency in public life. This law will be improved so that it is more effective.


We have to make special efforts to strengthen the administrative machinery for our rural programmes. Those who live in villages and semi-urban areas should get services similar to the residents of urban areas. Communication and Information Technology can go a long way in achieving this objective. Recently, we have set up the Unique Identification Authority of India. This is a historic step to link up the whole country through a high quality administrative arrangement. We expect the first set of identity numbers to be available in the next one to one and a half years.


Today, as I stand before you I can feel the energy of more than 100 crore Indians marching ahead on the path of progress. Some people question whether India will ever be able to attain its true potential. I have no doubt about this. We are rapidly moving forward. We have faith in ourselves. We have political stability. Our democracy is an example for the whole world. We are gaining in economic strength. And most importantly, we have full confidence in our youth. They are our future. I am sure that they will take our country to a new glory.


Let us all commit ourselves today to working for a golden future. On this sacred occasion let us resolve that nation building will be our highest duty.


	Jai Hind
	Jai Hind
	Jai Hind.”

"
2010,"
        
          Following is the text of the Prime
Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh’s address from the ramparts of Red Fort on the
occasion of Independence Day:
 
   
""Dear citizens,
 
           I greet you on the 63rd anniversary of our independence.  When
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru unfurled the Tricolour on this historic Red Fort, on 15th
August, 1947, he called himself the first servant of India.  I address you
today in the same spirit of service.
 
                    A few days
back, many precious lives were lost in Laddakh due to a cloud burst.  I
convey my heart felt condolences to the family members and other near and dear
ones of those who have perished.  In this hour of grief, the whole country
stands with the people of Laddakh.  It is my assurance that the Central
Government will do everything possible for rehabilitation of the affected
people.
 
          
When I addressed you last year on
Independence Day, our country was facing a number of difficulties.  There
was a drought like situation in many parts of the country.  We were also
affected by the global economic slow down.  I am happy to say that we have
acquitted ourselves well in these difficult circumstances.  Despite many
problems, the rate of our economic growth has been better than most other
countries in the world.  This shows the strength of our economy.
 
          This strength has been evident not only in the last one year but also in
our economic progress in the last many years.  Today, India stands among
the fastest growing economies of the world.  As the world's largest
democracy, we have become an example for many other countries to emulate. 
Our citizens have the right to make their voice heard.  Our country is
viewed with respect all over the world.  Our views command attention in
international fora.
 
           All of you have contributed to India's success.  The hard work of
our workers, our artisans, our farmers has brought our country to where it
stands today.  I specially salute our soldiers whose bravery ensures the
safety of our borders.  I pay tribute to all those martyrs who have
sacrificed their lives for our country.
 
           We are
building a new India in which every citizen would have a stake, an India which
would be prosperous and in which all citizens would be able to live a life of
honour and dignity in an environment of peace and goodwill.  An India in
which all problems could be solved through democratic means.  An India in
which the basic rights of every citizen would be protected.  In the last
few years, we have taken many significant steps in this direction.  Every
person living in rural areas now has the assurance of 100 days of employment
through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.  The
Right to Information Act is helping our citizens to become more aware.
 This year our Government has enacted the Right to Education which will
help every Indian to share in the benefits of the country's economic progress
and also to contribute to it.  To ensure equal partnership of women in our
progress, we have taken initiative for reservation for women in Parliament and
in State legislatures.  Apart from this, reservation for women has been
increased to 50 per cent in local bodies.  
 
          Despite our many strengths, we face some serious challenges.  We
should resolve today that we will meet these challenges as one people. 
Our society often gets divided in the name of religion, State, caste or
language.  We should resolve that we will not allow divisions in our
society under any circumstance.  Tolerance and generosity have been a part
of our traditions.  We should strengthen these traditions.  As we
progress economically our society should also become more
sensitive.   We should be modern and progressive in our outlook.
 
          Our Government has laid special emphasis on the welfare of our farmers
and on increasing agricultural production.  After we came to power in
2004, we realized that the state of Indian agriculture in the preceding 7-8
years was not satisfactory.  Our Government increased public investment in
agriculture.  We started new schemes for increasing production.  We
encouraged agricultural planning at the district level.  I am happy that
the growth rate of our agriculture has increased substantially in the last few
years.  But we are still far from achieving our goal.  We need to
work harder so that we can increase the agricultural growth rate to 4 per cent
per annum.
 
          Our Government wants a food safety net in which no citizen of ours would
go hungry.  This requires enhanced agricultural production which is
possible only by increasing productivity.  Our country has not witnessed
any big technological breakthrough in agriculture after the Green
Revolution.  We need technology which would address the needs of dry land
agriculture.  In addition, our agriculture should also be able to deal
with new challenges like climate change, falling levels of ground water and
deteriorating quality of soil.    In the history of Indian
agriculture, Norman Borlaug commands a special place.  About 40 to 50
years back he developed new and more productive seeds of wheat.  Under the
leadership of Smt. Indira Gandhiji, India achieved the Green Revolution by
adopting these seeds.  I am happy to announce that the Borlaug Institute
of South Asia is being established in India.  This institute would
facilitate availability of new and improved seeds and new technology to the farmers
of  India and other countries of South Asia.
 
          We have always taken care to provide remunerative prices to farmers so
that they are encouraged to increase  production.  Support prices
have been increased every year in the last six years.  The support price
for wheat was enhanced to Rs.1,100 per quintal last year from Rs.630 per
quintal in 2003-04.   In paddy, this increase was from Rs.550 per
quintal to Rs.1,000 per quintal.  But one effect of providing higher
prices to farmers is that food prices in the open market also increase.
 
           I know that
in the last few months high inflation has caused you difficulties.  It is
the poor who are the worst affected by rising prices, especially when the
prices of commodities of every day use like foodgrains, pulses, vegetables
increase.  It is for this reason that we have endeavored to minimize the
burden of increased prices on the poor.  Today, I do not want to go into
the detailed reasons for high inflation.  But, I would certainly like to
say that we are making every possible effort to tackle this problem.  I am
also confident that we will succeed in these efforts.
 
          It is obvious that any person or institution cannot spend more than his
income over a long period of time, even if it is the Government.  It is
our responsibility that we manage our economy with prudence so that our
development is not affected adversely in the future because of high debt. 
We import about 80 per cent of our requirement of petroleum products. After
2004, we have increased the prices of petroleum products much less compared to
the increase in the price of crude oil in the international market.  The
subsidy on petroleum products has been increasing every year.  It had
become necessary therefore to increase the prices of petroleum products. 
If this had not been done, it would not have been possible for our budget to
bear the burden of subsidy and our programmes for education, health and
employment of the poor would have been adversely affected. 
                                                                                                          

          In the 63 years after independence, India has covered a long distance on
the path of development.  But our destination is still far away.  A
large part of our population still suffers from persistent poverty, hunger and
disease.  When our Government came to power in 2004, we resolved to build
a new India under a progressive social agenda.  We wanted the fruits of
development to reach the common man.  We initiated programmes especially
targeted to the welfare of the socially and economically backward sections of
our society.  We still stand committed to the welfare of the poor, the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, minorities, women and other backward
sections of our society.  But today we do not need many new programmes to
achieve our goals.  However, we do need to implement the schemes we have
already started more effectively, minimizing the chances of corruption and
misuse of public money.  We want to achieve this in partnership with the
State Governments, Panchayat Raj Institutions and civil society groups.
 
          Secularism is one of the pillars of our democracy.  It has been the
tradition of our country and society to treat all religions with equal
respect.  For centuries India has welcomed new religions and all have
flourished here.  Secularism is also our constitutional obligation. 
Our Government is committed to maintain communal peace and harmony.  We
also consider it our duty to protect the minorities and provide for their special
needs.  This is why we have started many new programmes in the last four
years for the welfare of our brothers and sisters belonging to the minority
communities.  These include scholarships for minority students and special
programmes for the development of districts which have a high concentration of
minorities.  These schemes have shown good results.  We will
vigorously take this work forward.
 
          We have been giving special attention to education and health in the
last six years.  Improvement in these two areas is an important component
of our strategy for inclusive growth.  It is also necessary for higher
economic growth in the years to come.  After independence, these two areas
could not get the importance they deserved.  We tried to change this state
of affairs in the 11th Plan.  Today, almost every child in our
country has access to primary education.  Now, we need to pay more
attention to secondary and higher education.  We also need to improve the
quality of education at all levels.  It is our endeavour that every child,
irrespective of whether he is rich or poor and which section of the society he
belongs to, should be given an education that enables him to realize his
potential and makes him a responsible citizen of our  country.  We
will continue to implement the new schemes that we have started in the last six
years in the areas of education and health with sincerity and hard work and in
partnership with the State Governments.  We will soon bring a Bill to
Parliament for constitution of two separate councils in higher education and
health respectively so that reforms in these two areas can be accelerated.
 
          Nutritious food and good health services are necessary but not enough
for ensuring good health of our citizens.  We also need cleanliness and
good sanitation in our villages, towns and cities.  There are many
diseases which would be difficult to prevent otherwise.  The truth is that
our country lags behind in this area.  I consider it a primary
responsibility of all our citizens to maintain cleanliness and hygiene around
them.  I would like our children to be taught the importance of
cleanliness and hygiene in schools from the very beginning under a campaign for
a Clean India.  I appeal to the State Governments, Panchayat Raj
Institutions, civil society groups and common citizens to make this campaign
successful.
 
          Mahatma Gandhi had said that our earth
has enough for everyone's need but not for everyone's greed.  Imprudent
use of the earth's natural resources has resulted in the problem of climate
change.  We need to use our natural resources with care and
prudence.  It is our responsibility towards the coming generations to
protect and preserve our forests, rivers and mountains.  Our government
will endeavour to take care of environmental concerns in our projects for
economic development.
 
          There is a large deficit in our
physical infrastructure which affects our economic development adversely. 
There is a shortfall in the supply of electricity to industries.  Our
roads, ports and airports are not of world standards.  We have been trying
to increase electricity production and improve our roads, ports and
airports.  The resources required to create good physical infrastructure
are difficult for the Government alone to mobilize.  Therefore, we have
endeavoured to involve the private sector in our efforts.  The steps that
we have taken after 2004 to improve our physical infrastructure have started
bearing fruit now.  About one and half a months back, I dedicated a new
terminal of the Delhi airport to the nation.  This is an excellent
terminal which has been completed in record time. We will continue to make such
efforts to improve our physical infrastructure.
 
          There has been much discussion
recently on the issue of internal security.  If law and order in any part
of India deteriorates or peace and harmony gets disturbed, the common man is
adversely affected.  Therefore, it is one of the primary responsibilities
of any government to maintain law and order so that the citizens can live and
earn their livelihood in an atmosphere of peace and harmony.  Naxalism is
a serious challenge to our internal security.  I pay tribute to the men
and officers of our security forces who have became martyrs in the attacks by
naxalites in the last few months.  I have stated this before and I say it
again - our Government will fully discharge its responsibility to protect each
and every citizen of our country.  We will deal firmly with those who
resort to violence.  We will provide all possible help to State Governments
to maintain the rule of law in areas affected by naxalism.  I once again
appeal to naxalites to abjure violence, come for talks with the Government and
join hands with us to accelerate social and economic development.  A few
days back I took a meeting with the Chief Ministers of States affected by
naxalism.  We will fully implement the consensus that emerged in that
meeting.  I would like to repeat here a point that I made in that
meeting.  It is imperative that Centre and States work together to meet
the challenge of naxalism.  It would be very difficult for any State to
tackle this problem without cooperation from the Centre and coordination
between States.  We all need to rise above our personal and political
interests to meet this challenge.
 
          As I have stated earlier, most
naxalite affected areas lag behind in development.  Many such areas also
have a large concentration of our adivasi brothers and sisters.  We want
to end the neglect of these areas.  I have asked the Planning Commission
to formulate a comprehensive scheme towards this end, which we would implement
fully.  It is also our endeavour that our adivasi brothers and sisters
join the mainstream of development.  They have been dependent on forest
produce for centuries and this dependence should not end without the creation
of new sources of livelihood.  Apart from adequate compensation for land
which is acquired from them, we should also ensure that our adivasi brothers
and sisters have a stake in the developmental project being undertaken.
 
          I would like to state one more thing
in this context.  It is very necessary to make the administrative
machinery more sensitive in areas affected by naxalism.  The government
officials who work there should not only be sincere but should also be alive to
the special needs of our adivasi brothers and sisters.   It is my
hope that the State Governments will pay adequate attention to these
requirements. 
 
          We have a special responsibility
towards the States of the North East.  We are trying to live up to that
responsibility.  The North Eastern part of our country has been witness to
some unpleasant incidents in the recent months.  I would like to convey to
all political parties and groups of the North East that disputes in the name of
State or tribe can only harm all of us.  Discussion and dialogue are the
only options to resolve complex issues.  As far as the Central Government
is concerned, we are ready to take forward every process of talks which could
lead to progress in resolution of problems. 
 
          In Jammu and Kashmir, we are ready to
talk to every person or group which abjures violence.  Kashmir is an
integral part of India.  Within this framework, we are ready to move
forward in any talks which would increase the partnership of the common man in
governance and also enhance their welfare.  Recently, some young men have
lost their lives in violence in Jammu and Kashmir.  We deeply regret
this.  The years of violence should now end.  Such violence would not
benefit anyone.  I believe that India's democracy has the generosity and
flexibility to be able to address the concerns of any area or group in the
country.  I recently participated in a meeting with political parties from
Jammu and Kashmir.  We will endeavour to take this process forward. 
I would like to convey to our countrymen, especially our citizens in Jammu and
Kashmir and in the North East, that they should adopt democratic means to join
hands with us for their and country's welfare.
 
          We want prosperity, peace and harmony
in our neighbouring countries. Whatever differences we have with our
neighbouring countries, we want to resolve them through discussions.  As
far as Pakistan is concerned, we expect from them that they would not let their
territory be used for acts of terrorism against India.  We have been emphasizing
this in all our discussions with the Pakistan Government.  If this is not
done, we cannot progress far in our dialogue with Pakistan. 
 
          I would also like to say something
which is related to our glorious cultural traditions.  The use of harsh and
unpleasant words in our political discourse has increased in recent days. 
This is against our traditions of generosity, humility and tolerance. 
Criticism has a place of its own in a democracy and in a progressive
society.  However, criticism should not be undignified.  We should
have the capacity to reconcile opposite points of view on important issues
through debate and discussion.  I would request all political parties to
consider this issue.  
 
          The Commonwealth Games will start in
Delhi after about one and a half months.  This will be a proud moment for
the whole country and especially for Delhi. I am convinced that all our
countrymen will treat the Games as a national festival and will leave no stone
unturned to make them a success.  The successful organization of
Commonwealth Games would be another signal to the world that India is rapidly
marching ahead with confidence.
 
          Our future is bright.  The day
when our dreams will come true is not far off.  Let us all resolve on this
anniversary of our independence that we will keep the flag of our nation flying
high.  Let us march ahead together on the path of progress and prosperity.
 
          Dear children, please say Jai Hind with me.
 
 'JAI HIND'
'JAI HIND'
'JAI HIND'”

"
2011,"
The Prime Minister,
Dr. Manmohan Singh addressed the nation today from the ramparts of Red Fort on
the occasion of the 64th Anniversary of Independence of the country.
Following is the English rendering of the Prime Minister Speech:
 
“My dear countrymen,
 
I heartily greet
120 crore Indians on the 64th anniversary of our independence.
 
I have been addressing
you from the historic Red Fort for the last seven years. In these seven years,
our country has achieved much.  During
this period, we have travelled rapidly on the path of development and have seen
success in many areas.  However, I am
also well aware that a lot remains to be done. 
We have to banish poverty and illiteracy from our country.  We have to provide the common man with access
to improved health services.  We have to
provide employment opportunities to each one of our youth.  
 
                The
road ahead is long and arduous.  Particularly,
the prevailing situation both inside and outside the country is such that if we
do not act with understanding and restraint, our security and prosperity can
get adversely affected.  The world
economy is slowing down.  The developed
countries especially America
and countries of Western Europe are facing
economic problems. There is unrest in many Arab countries of the Middle East.  There
are some people who want to create disturbances in the country so that our
progress gets stalled. All this can have a negative impact on us.  But we will not let this happen.  I know that if we work together, we can face
any challenge.  However, it is necessary
that we rise above personal or political interests and build consensus on issues
of vital national importance.
 
                We
are building the edifice of modern India on the foundation of the hard
work and sacrifices of our soldiers, our farmers and our workers. We will not
let their hard work and sacrifices go waste. 
We will convert the dreams of our freedom fighters into reality.
 
                In
the last seven years, our government has strived for political stability and
social and economic progress.  We have
established an environment of communal harmony in the country.  
 
                In
these seven years, the pace of our economic development has been rapid.  We have achieved this success despite the
global economic slow-down of 2008 and rising prices of energy and commodities
in world markets.
 
                We
have strived for reducing inequalities in the country.  In the last seven years, we have taken
special care of the needs of our brothers and sisters from the Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes, minorities, women and children.
 
                We
have enacted laws which would guarantee our people their basic entitlements.  After the rights to education, employment and
information, we will soon enact a legislation for providing food security to
the people.
 
                In
the last seven years, our relations with various countries of the world have
strengthened and deepened. It is only the result of our hard work that today we
have much more self respect and self-confidence in ourselves.
 
                These
successes are not ordinary. Today the world recognizes our potential to be one
of the major economic powers globally. 
But the problem of corruption is a big obstacle in such a transformation.
 
                In
the last few months many instances of corruption have come to light.  In some cases, functionaries of the Central government
face allegations of corruption.  In other
cases, it is the functionaries of various State governments.
 
We are taking the
strictest possible action in cases of corruption that have surfaced.  These cases are sub-judice and hence I will
say nothing more on this subject.
 
                It
is essential that when we consider these issues, we do not create an atmosphere
in which the country's progress comes into question.  Any debate on these matters should reflect
the confidence that we can overcome these challenges.
 
                Corruption
manifests itself in many forms.  In some
instances, funds meant for schemes for the welfare of the common man end up in
the pocket of government officials.  In
some other instances government discretion is used to favour a selected
few.  There are also cases where
government contracts are wrongfully awarded to the wrong people.  We cannot let such activities continue unchecked.
 
                I
believe that there is no single big step which we can take to eradicate
corruption.  In fact, we will have to act
simultaneously on many fronts.
 
                We
will have to improve our justice delivery system.  Everyone should know that quick action will
be taken against the corrupt and punishment meted out to them.  If our system delivers justice in an
effective manner, government officials would think twice before committing a
wrong act out of greed or under political pressure.
 
                We
want a strong Lokpal to prevent corruption in high places.  We have recently introduced a Bill in
Parliament to achieve this.  Now only Parliament
can decide what type of Lokpal legislation should be enacted.  I am aware of the differences of opinion on
some aspects of the Bill.  Those who don't
agree with this Bill can put forward their views to Parliament, political
parties and even the press.  However, I
also believe that they should not resort to hunger strikes and fasts unto
death.
 
                It
is not appropriate to bring the judiciary under the ambit of Lokpal.  We believe that any such provision would go
against the independence of the judiciary. 
However, we do need a framework in which the judiciary becomes more
accountable.  It is with this aim that we
have introduced the Judicial Accountability Bill in Parliament.  I am confident that this Bill will be passed
soon.
 
                An
alert press and an aware citizenry can be very helpful in the fight against
corruption.  The Indian press is known for
its independence and activism throughout the world.  The Right to Information legislation that we
have enacted has enabled our press and people to keep a strict watch on the
work of the government.
 
                Today
many government decisions, which in the absence of this Act would escape public
scrutiny, are coming to light.  I believe
that this is a big step forward in eradicating corruption.
 
                Many
times, government discretion is misused in allocation of scarce resources and
in the grant of clearances.  We have examined
this issue.  We will put an end to such
discretionary powers wherever possible.
 
                Any
government awards contracts worth thousands of crores every year.  There are frequent complaints of corruption
in these decisions.  We had constituted a
committee to suggest measures to reduce corruption in government purchases.  The committee has recommended that, like many
other countries, we should also have a public procurement legislation which
lays down the principles and practice with regard to government purchases.  We will introduce a Bill in Parliament by the
end of this year to enact such a law.
 
                In
recent years, we have established independent regulatory authorities in many
areas.  These authorities discharge many
responsibilities which were earlier in the domain of the government itself.  We have no legislation which would enable
monitoring of the work of these regulatory authorities and make them more
accountable, without, however, compromising their independence.  We are also considering enactment of such a
law.
 
                I
have said so much on corruption because I know that this problem is a matter of
deep concern for all of us.  However,
this is a difficulty for which no government has a magic wand.  We are taking simultaneous action on many
fronts in our fight against corruption. 
We want all political parties to stand shoulder to shoulder with us in
this fight.  To eradicate corruption, we
have introduced, and will introduce, many Bills in Parliament.  I hope that all political parties will
cooperate in the process of converting these Bills into statutes.  On the issue of corruption, I would like to
say in the end that we can win the fight against corruption only when each and
every citizen of India
cooperates in it.
 
                I
congratulate the country's farmers for their achievements this year.  The production of foodgrains has been at a
record level.  Wheat, maize, pulses and
oilseeds have all seen record levels of production.  It is because of the hard work of our farmers
that today there are proposals for export of foodgrains, sugar and cotton.
 
                We
need a second Green Revolution in agriculture.  We can tackle the problem of rising food
prices only by increasing agricultural production and productivity.  We also need to increase agricultural production
to implement a food security law.  We
will accelerate our efforts in this direction in the 12th Plan.
 
                Today,
I wish to assure our farmer brothers and sisters, particularly those who are small
and marginal, that we will continue to take care of their special needs.  It will be our endeavour to ensure that our
farmers have easy access to fertilizers, seeds and credit.  We also want to provide the best possible
irrigation facilities to the farmers so that their dependence on rains is
reduced.
 
                Our
country is passing through a phase of sustained high inflation.  Controlling rising prices is a primary
responsibility of any government.  Our
government fully understands this responsibility.  We have continuously taken steps to rein in
prices.  Some time we have been confronted
with a situation in which the reasons for rising prices lay outside the country.  The prices of petroleum products, foodgrains
and edible oil have risen steeply in international markets in recent
times.  Since we import these products in
large quantities, any rise in their prices adds to inflationary pressure in our
country.  Sometimes we have been
successful too in controlling inflation. 
But this success has not proved lasting. 
A few days back, the people's concern at rising prices was also reflected
in a discussion in Parliament.  I wish to
assure you today that we are continuously monitoring the situation to find out
what new steps can be taken to arrest rising prices.  Finding a solution to this problem will be
our top-most priority in the coming months.
 
                I
am fully aware of the tensions caused in some parts of the country because of acquisition
of land for industry, infrastructure and urbanization.  Our farmers have been especially affected by
such acquisition.  Land acquisition is no
doubt necessary for projects of public interest.  But it should take place in a transparent and
fair manner.  The interests of those
whose livelihoods are dependent on the land being acquired should be fully
protected.  We will ensure that no
injustice is done to anyone in the process of land acquisition.  Our government wants to replace the 117 year
old land acquisition law by a new Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation law which
is forward looking and balanced.  We have
already prepared a draft legislation and have initiated steps to build
consensus on it.  We will soon introduce
a Bill in Parliament to this end.
 
                We
are satisfied with our achievements in the last seven years in the areas of
education and health.  Whether it is
elementary education, secondary education or higher education we have taken
concrete steps for improvements at all levels. 
This has shown good results.  In
the last few years, fundamental changes have taken place in the area of
education.  Today every citizen has a
right to elementary education.  We are
now considering universalization of secondary education.  Vocational education and skill development
have acquired a new importance.  In view
of these major changes, it is necessary that we consider all aspects of
education in a comprehensive manner. 
Therefore we have decided to appoint an education commission to make
recommendations for improvements at all levels of education.
 
                I
have often referred to the 11th Five Year Plan as an education
plan.  We will lay the same emphasis on
health in the 12th plan as we laid on education in the 11th plan.  I will propose to the National Development
Council that the 12th plan should be specially focused on
health.  I also promise that funds will
not be a constraint in the important areas of education and health.
 
                For
a long time our country had no facility for health insurance for workers in the
unorganized sector.  In 2008, we began
the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana for workers in the unorganized sector who
are below the poverty line.  In the last
year we have covered those getting employment under Mahatma Gandhi Rural
Employment Act and also domestic workers, street vendors and beedi workers
under this scheme.  Today the Rashtriya
Swasthya Bima Yojana covers about 2 crore 50 lakh workers.  Our government will endeavour to cover as
many unorganized sector workers as possible under this scheme.
 
                We
are continuously strengthening the physical infrastructure in our country.  This is an area which requires very large
investments.  It is for this reason that in
the last seven years we have pursued policies which encourage investment in
infrastructure.   As a percentage of GDP,
investment in this area has grown more than one and a half times in the last
seven years. There have been improvements in our capacities in the petroleum
sector and power generation, and in our airports, roads, especially rural road,
and ports.  As an illustration, the
capacity in power generation that we are going to add in the 11th
plan will be twice that of the 10th plan.  In the 12th Plan, we will further
accelerate investment in infrastructure. 
We will pay special attention to the remote areas of our country and to
rural areas.  Connecting such areas by
rail and road will get the top most priority.
 
                We
have taken a major step this year for our poor brothers and sisters living in
cities.  Recently we have approved the Rajiv
Awas Yojana.  We want to make India slum free
through this scheme.  We want the slum dwellers
to get ownership of clean houses and have access to basic amenities like water
and electricity.  We will implement the
Rajiv Awas Yojana as a national mission together with the States.  
 
                Malnutrition
in our women and children is a matter of concern for all of us.  We have taken a number of steps to tackle
this problem, including two new schemes. 
We have also decided that we will start implementing an improved Integrated
Child Development Services scheme within the next six months so that the
problem of malnutrition in children can be effectively addressed.  
 
                The
figures of census 2011 show improvements in most areas.  But it is a matter of deep regret for us that
the sex ratio has shown a decline from the level of the last census.  For an improvement in this state of affairs,
it is not only necessary to implement the existing laws effectively but it is also
essential to change the approach with which our society views girls and
women.  I would especially appeal to the
State governments and social service organizations to take steps for
empowerment of women and for improving their status in society.
 
                Last
month's terrorists attacks in Mumbai warn us that there cannot be any slip up in
our vigilance as far as the fight against terrorism is concerned. This is a
long battle to be fought jointly by the Central Government, the State
Governments and the common man.  We have
been steadily strengthening our intelligence and security agencies and will
continue to do so in the future also.  
 
                We
are also taking all possible steps to overcome the challenge of naxalism.  We want to eradicate the very reasons which
give rise to this problem.  Therefore we
have started a new scheme for the accelerated development of 60 backward and
tribal dominated districts.  An amount of
Rs. 3300 crore will be spent on this scheme in a period of two years.
 
                Preserving
our environment even as we develop rapidly is a huge challenge for us. Climate
change poses a threat to both our development processes and our natural
resources.  We have established eight
missions on climate change and are working hard to implement these
missions.  We have set up the National
Ganga River Basin Authority for the protection and cleaning of river Ganga.  We have
also established the National Green Tribunal for quick disposal of cases
involving environmental issues.  In the coming
months, we will constitute an environmental assessment and monitoring authority
to streamline the process of environmental clearances.
 
Our society and
country are changing rapidly because of our fast economic growth.  Today our people look towards the future with
new hope.  They have higher
aspirations.  Our young men and women strive
for path breaking achievements.  We
should all build an environment in the country in which the energy and
enthusiasm of the people are channelised into activities of nation
building.  Our institutions should
encourage constructive utilization of the potential of our people.  Our entrepreneurs and businessmen should not feel
constrained in their activities.  Our
industrialists should have the opportunity to set up new industries so that our
youth can get additional avenues for productive employment.  We should all stay away from politics that
create suspicion or apprehension amongst those connected with industry,
business and investment.
 
                It
is not an ordinary achievement for our democracy with a population of 120 crore
and so many religions, languages and cultures to march rapidly ahead on the
path of development.  I congratulate the
people of India
on this achievement.  But we must ensure that
inequalities do not increase even as we develop rapidly.  
 
                We
have embarked on a journey to transform our huge and diverse country through
rapid development.  A development which
benefits every citizen of the country. 
It is natural that tensions would sometimes arise in this process of
change.  In a democracy, such tensions
also become issues of political polarization. 
We should endeavour that even as political parties oppose and engage in
debate against each other, the pace of our progress does not get affected.
 
                We
should also have faith that our democracy, our institutions and our social
ideals and values have the capacity to deal with any difficulty.  We should all have faith in ourselves.  The faith that we can build a promising
future for ourselves.  The faith, that
united we can do the most difficult of tasks. 
Let us all resolve to build a bright future for our country.
 
Dear Children, join me in saying 
Jai Hind
Jai Hind                           
Jai Hind.”

MP/RCJ/SC/SH/SKS/RK/SK
"
2012,"

                PM's address from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of Independence Day 2012 

                Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, addressed the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort today on the occasion of Independence Day. Following is the English rendering of the Prime Minister’s speech.

“My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters and dear children, 
I greet you all on this anniversary of our Independence. 

“The leaders of our freedom movement, under the stewardship of Mahatma Gandhi, had dreamt of an independent and prosperous India.  On this day in 1947, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru took the first step towards the realization of that dream by hoisting the Tricolour at the Red Fort.  The journey we began on 15 August, 1947 is now 65 years old. We have achieved much in these 65 years. 

Today is certainly a day to celebrate the success of our democracy.  However, on this occasion we should also introspect about what remains to be done. We would achieve independence in the true sense only when we are able to banish poverty, illiteracy, hunger and backwardness from our country.  This would be possible only when we learn from our failures and build on our successes. 

You are aware that these days the global economy is passing through a difficult phase.  The pace of economic growth has come down in all countries of the world.  Seen together, the European countries are estimated to grow at 0 percent this year.  Our country has also been affected by these adverse external conditions.  Also, there have been domestic developments which are hindering our economic growth.  Last year our GDP grew by 6.5 percent.  This year we hope to do a little better. 

We cannot do much about the conditions that prevail outside our country.  But we must make every effort to resolve the problems inside our country so that our economic growth and the creation of employment opportunities in the country are again speeded up.

While doing this, we must also control inflation.  This would pose some difficulty because of a bad monsoon this year.  However, we have taken many measures to deal with the situation. In districts where there has been a deficit of 50 percent or more in the rainfall, diesel subsidy is being provided to farmers by the Government.  Seed subsidy has been enhanced.  Funds available under the Central scheme for fodder have been increased.  Our effort is to ensure that people do not face difficulty due to shortage  of seeds, fodder or water in any part of the country.  It is good that we have a big stock of foodgrains because of the hard work of our farmer brothers and sisters, and availability of foodgrains  is not a problem for us. 

As far as creating an environment within the country for rapid economic growth is concerned, I believe that we are not being able to achieve this because of a lack of political consensus on many issues.  Time has now come to view the issues which affect our development processes as matters of national security. 

If we do not increase the pace of the country’s economic growth, take steps to encourage new investment in the economy, improve the management of Government finances and work  for the livelihood security of the common man and energy security of the country, then it most certainly affects our national security. 

I promise to you today that our Government will work hard for India’s rapid economic growth and for shielding the country from the effects of the global economic slowdown. I promise that we will work hard for creation of new employment opportunities for our young men and women living in villages and cities.  We will make every possible effort to secure the livelihood of our poor brothers and sister, our workers and our farmers.  We will leave no stone unturned to encourage investment in our country so that our entrepreneurs can make a substantial contribution to our economy. 

I believe that this period of difficulties will not last long. Even as we face these problems, we should be encouraged by the fact that we have achieved extraordinary successes in many areas in the last 8 years.  We now need to replicate these successes in newer areas. 

It has been our endeavour in the last 8 years to empower our citizens socially and economically so that they can contribute to the sacred task of nation building.
Today, one out of every 5 households in the country has become eligible to benefit from the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Act through a job card.  In only the last one year we have provided employment to more than 8 crore people under this scheme. 

When the UPA Government came to power in 2004,  we had promised that we would provide electricity to all villages.  To fulfill this promise, we launched the Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme.  More than 1 lakh new villages have been provided with electricity connections under this scheme and now almost all the villages in the country have been electrified. Our next target is to provide electricity to each and every household in our country in the next 5 years and to also improve the supply of electricity. 

No praise is high enough for our hard working farmers.  They have produced a record output of crops successively in the last 2 years.  Because of our Government's efforts for development of agriculture and for protecting the interests of farmers, agriculture has grown at an average rate of 3.3 per cent in the 11th Plan which is substantially higher than the 2.4 per cent we achieved in the 10th Plan.  In the last 8 years, we have doubled the support prices of crops.  We are providing loans at low interest rates to lakhs of farmers. 

Our children are the biggest strength of our country.  If our children are provided with good education and are healthy, then our future would be bright. 

This is the reason why we have paid special attention to the needs of children in our policies and programmes.  The education of children has been made mandatory by law.  In the year 2006-07, only 93 per cent of children in the age group 6-14 years were getting admission in schools.  Today almost all children in this age group are being admitted to schools.  More than 51,000 new schools have been opened in the country and about 7 lakh teachers appointed in them in just the last 2 years.  Now we will focus on improving the quality of education.  In the next few months we will put in place a system of continuous assessment of the benefit our children are getting from teaching.  Participation of the community and parents would be ensured so that they can be satisfied with the quality of teaching. 

The Mid-day-meal Scheme provides nutritious meals in schools for about 12 crore children everyday.  This is the biggest scheme of its kind in the world. 

In the last one and half years no new case of polio has come to light and now India does not figure in the list of countries affected by this disease. 

Malnutrition in children is a big challenge for us.  We have taken steps in many dimensions to deal with this problem.  In the last 8 years, the number of mothers and children benefitting from the ICDS has doubled.  The process of making the ICDS more effective is in its last stages and will be completed in the next 1 or 2 months. 

We had launched the National Rural Health Mission in 2005 so that health services can be extended to each village in the country.  Today this Mission is being implemented with the help of 10 lakh health personnel including 8.5 lakh Asha workers.  After the success of the National Rural health Mission, we now want to expand the scope of health services in our towns also.  The National Rural Health Mission will be converted into a National Health Mission which would cover all villages and towns in the country.  We are also formulating a scheme for distribution of free medicines through Government hospitals and health centres. 

We want to create many new job opportunities for our youth in the coming years.  To achieve this it is necessary that we train them in skills which our economy needs.  It is our endeavour to put in place a system in which training facilities are available in many new skills.  We also wish to provide short duration training courses of 6 weeks to 6 months for our young brothers and sisters.  The National Skill Development Council has formulated a major scheme for skill development in which 8 crore people will be trained in the next 5 years.  This is an ambitious scheme which can be implemented only through a specialized agency of the Central Government.  Therefore, we are considering the establishment of a National Skill Development Authority so that skill development programmes all over the country can be implemented in a coordinated manner.  We would also need contribution from the private sector and non-Governmental organizations in this work.

Creation of new employment opportunities is possible only when we encourage industry and trade.  For this we need to speedily improve our infrastructure.
Recently we have taken new measures to accelerate infrastructure development.  Ambitious targets have been fixed in roads, airports, railways, electricity generation and coal production.  The Government will take steps to increase investment for infrastructure development with the help of the private sector.  To attract foreign capital, we will have to create confidence at the international level that there are no barriers to investment in India. 

Just 10 years back only 3 out of every 10 households in our villages were benefitting from banking services.  Today more than half of the rural households get the benefit of bank accounts.  It will be our endeavour to ensure that all households benefit from bank accounts in the next 2 years. 

We want to create a system in which money from Government schemes -  pension for old people, scholarship for students and wages for labourers -  can be credited directly into people’s bank accounts.  This would reduce inconvenience to the beneficiaries, make it easy for them to receive payment and increase transparency.  For this work, we will take help from the Aadhar scheme under which about 20 crore people have been registered so far. 

To provide housing for our poor brothers and sisters residing in urban areas of our country we will soon launch the Rajiv Housing Loan Scheme.  Under this scheme, people belonging to the economically weaker sections would be given relief on interest for housing loans of less than Rs. 5 lakh. 

This year we will present the Twelfth Five Year Plan for consideration of the National Development Council.  The Plan would determine the future course of action on all important matters relating to the country's development.  It would lay down measures for increasing our present rate of economic growth from 6.5 to 9 per cent in the last year of the Plan.  The Plan would focus special attention on areas important from the point of view of reaching the fruits of development to each citizen of our country and specially to the weaker sections of our society.  I have full confidence that the Centre and the States will act  together to implement the Twelfth Plan in an effective manner. 

The incidents of violence which occurred in Assam recently are very unfortunate.  I know that these incidents have resulted in the disruption of the lives of a large number of people.  We fully sympathize with those families which have been affected by the violence.  We are doing everything possible to provide relief to them.  I also promise to you that our Government will make every effort to understand the reasons behind the violence and work hard with the State Governments  to ensure that such incidents are not repeated in any part of the country. 

We have achieved success in many areas of internal security.  In Jammu and Kashmir, people participated in large numbers in the Panchayat elections.  There has been a reduction in violence in the North Eastern States and we are engaged in dialogue with many groups there so that they can join the mainstream of development.  We have initiated new schemes of development in areas affected by naxal violence to ensure that the grievances of the people residing there, especially our brothers and sisters belonging to Scheduled Tribes, can be removed and their lot can be improved.  However, we need to be constantly vigilant as far as internal security is concerned. Communal harmony has to be maintained at all costs.  Naxalism is still a serious problem.  The incidents which occurred in Pune in the beginning of this month point to the need for much more work to be done in the area of national security.  We will continue to do this work with sincerity in the future also.

I would like to congratulate our scientists and technologists who have enhanced  our prestige by successfully testing the Agni V Missile and launching the RISAT- I Satellite in space this year.  Recently the Cabinet has approved the Mars Orbiter Mission.  Under this Mission, our spaceship will go near Mars and collect important scientific information.  This spaceship to Mars will be a huge step for us in the area of science and technology. 

We have seen a lot of discussion in the recent months about the role of our armed forces and their preparedness.  I would like to emphasise here that our armed forces and paramilitary forces have defended  the security of our country both during war and peace with valour and honour.  Our soldiers have made the biggest of sacrifices,  whenever needed.  Today I would like to reassure our countrymen that our armed forces and paramilitary forces are prepared to face any challenge.  The Government will continue to work for  modernizing these forces and providing them with the necessary technology and equipment.  Today,  I would like to thank our security forces, who are guarding our frontiers bravely, from the bottom of my heart.  We will continue to make efforts for their welfare. 

Our Government has set up a committee to examine issues relating to pay and pension of armed forces personnel. This committee will also look into matters concerning pension of retired men and officers and family pension being paid to their families.  We will take prompt action on the recommendations of the committee, once they are received.  

Our Government has paid special attention to the welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, minorities, women and other weaker sections.  The special needs of our tribal and backward districts are being met through programmes such as the Integrated Action Plan,  Backward Regions Grant Fund and Tribal Sub Plan.  Through the  Forest Rights Act, we have given proprietary rights to lakhs of our brothers and sisters belonging to Scheduled Tribes on land on which they have been living for generations.  We are formulating a scheme to ensure that people belonging to Scheduled Tribes can get fair and remunerative prices for the forest produce they collect.  The Government wants to speedily convert the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Bill into a legislation. Through this law we want to provide funds for the benefit of our  tribal brothers and sisters in the mining areas.

We will make the 15 points programme for minorities more effective.  The Multi-Sectoral Development Programme being implemented in districts with large minority populations will be expanded.

We have enhanced the amount of post-matric scholarship available to children belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and minorities.  Our efforts to make these scholarship schemes more effective will continue.We are considering a new and effective law to put an end to the repulsive practice of manual scavenging and to provide opportunities to those engaged in this practice to begin their lives afresh.  

Our commitment to make the work of the Government and administration transparent and accountable stands.  On the last Independence Day,  I promised you that we would take many steps for this purpose. I am happy to state that during the last 1 year we have achieved good progress in this area.  The Lok Sabha has cleared the Lokpal  and Lokayukta Bill.  We hope that all political parties will help us in passing this Bill in the Rajya Sabha.  A number of other Bills have also been presented before the Parliament.  The Cabinet has cleared a Public Procurement Bill.  We will continue our efforts to bring more transparency and accountability in the work of public servants and to reduce corruption.  But we will also take care that these measures do not result in a situation in which the morale of public functionaries taking decisions in public interest gets affected because of baseless allegations and unnecessary litigation. 

In my first message to the country after assuming the office of Prime Minister I had appealed to you to contribute to the sacred work of nation building.  I am very happy that today more of our citizens than ever before, and specially the youth, are taking interest in issues related to the progress of our society and country.  Our Government believes that the difficult problems which India faces can be resolved only with the cooperation of the common man.  It will be our endeavour that in the coming time, still more people help us in tasks like removal of poverty, illiteracy and inequality. 

I believe that no power in the world can stop our country from achieving new heights of progress and development.  What is needed is that we work together as one people for the success of our country.  Let us once more resolve that we will continue to work for a progressive, modern and prosperous India.” 

Dear children join me in saying                 
   Jai Hind, 
Jai Hind, 
Jai Hind.”

2013,"
 
Prime Minister, Dr.
Manmohan Singh, addressed the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort today on
the occasion of Independence Day. Following is the English rendering of the
Prime Minister’s address:
“My dear fellow-citizens,
Brothers, sisters and
dear children,
I greet you all on this Independence
Day.
Today is certainly a day of joy for us.
But on this celebration of independence we also feel pain in our hearts that
our brothers and sisters in Uttarakhand had to face devastation about two
months back. Our deepest sympathies are with all the families that suffered
loss of life or property. I want to assure the people of Uttarakhand today that
the whole country stands with them in this moment of crisis. Our government is
working with all the resources at its command to rehabilitate those whose
houses have been destroyed and rebuild damaged infrastructure.
Our army, paramilitary forces and
numerous officers and staff of the Central and State governments worked in
difficult conditions in partnership with the common people to perform an
outstanding task in providing relief to those who were stranded. We especially
pay homage to the officers and men of the Air Force, ITBP and NDRF who
sacrificed their lives to save others.
We are also deeply pained that we lost the
submarine, INS Sindurakshak in an accident yesterday.  Eighteen brave sailors are feared to have
lost their lives.  The accident is all
the more painful because the Navy had recently achieved two major successes in
the form of its first nuclear submarine, INS Arihant and the aircraft carrier,
INS Vikrant.
We pay homage to the brave hearts we
have lost.  We also congratulate the Navy
on its successes.
Brothers and Sisters,
We achieved independence in 1947 under
the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.  If we
look at our subsequent journey, we would find that our country has seen major
changes every ten years.
In the decade beginning 1950, India
took its first steps as a democratic republic under the leadership of Pandit
Jawahar Lal Nehru. We established institutions like the Atomic Energy
Commission, Planning Commission and Election Commission, which went on to make
a major contribution to the processes of nation building in later years. The
first general elections were conducted and a beginning was made towards the
formulation of the First Five Year Plan for socio-economic development of the
country.
In the Sixties, Pandit Nehru set up new
industries and factories, implemented new irrigation projects and opened new
universities. By laying emphasis on the role of Science and Technology in
nation building he started the work of transforming this ancient country into a
modern nation.
In the Seventies, Indiraji boosted our
confidence as a nation. During this period, we launched our first satellite in
space. The Green Revolution enabled us to be self sufficient in food grains for
the first time.
In the next decade, Rajiv Gandhi ji set
into motion the process of technological and economic modernization. The
foundation for the progress we later made in the area of Information Technology
was laid during this period. The importance of Panchayati Raj Institutions was
emphasized and this later resulted in amendments to our Constitutions for
strengthening and empowering these institutions.
In the year 1991, under the leadership
of Shri Narsimha Rao, we successfully negotiated a major economic crisis and
embraced reforms for strengthening our economy. These reforms were opposed by
many political parties at that time. But the reforms were in national interest
and were therefore continued by all governments that came to power
subsequently. Since then, the reform process has continually moved forward.
I believe that the last decade has also
been a decade of major changes in the history of our nation. In no other decade
has our economic development increased as much as in this decade. Democratic
forces have been strengthened and many sections of our society have joined the
mainstream of development for the first time. The common man has been given new
rights which have led to his social and economic empowerment.
Brothers and Sisters,
The first UPA government came to power
in May 2004. Ever since, we have worked with sincerity and honesty to build a
progressive and modern India.
We have envisioned a prosperous India.
An India which has got rid of centuries old burden of poverty, hunger and
disease. Where the light of education has driven away the darkness of ignorance
and superstition.
Where there is social equality and all
citizens enjoy equal economic opportunity. Where no section of the society
faces injustice and exploitation.
We have dreamt of an India where the
youth get employment opportunities that enable them to contribute to the noble
endeavour of nation building.
We have strived for India’s voice to be
heard loud and clear at the international level. We have strived to build a
nation that is looked at with respect and honour by the whole world.
We have taken many measures to realise
these dreams.  But the journey is long and
a large distance still remains to be travelled. 

Brothers and Sisters,
We have recently issued an Ordinance
towards  a Food Security law.  The Food Security Bill is now before
Parliament and we hope it will be passed shortly.  This law will benefit 75 percent of our rural
population and half of our urban population. Under the law, about 81 crore
Indians would be entitled to receive rice at 3 Rupees per kg, wheat at 2 Rupees
per kg and coarse grains at 1 Rupee per kg. This is the largest effort of its kind
in the whole world. 
We have been able to implement this law
only because of the hard work of our farmers. Our food-grain production reached
a record level of 25.9 crore ton in 2011-12. 
Without rapid agricultural growth, we
cannot achieve our goal of making our villages prosperous. We have constantly
endeavoured to increase production and to ensure that farmers get remunerative
prices for their produce. In the last 9 years, support prices for various crops
have been enhanced as never before. The support prices for wheat and paddy have
been more than doubled. Many States which faced shortages of food-grains
earlier are now producing more than what they require for themselves.
The average annual rate of agricultural
growth in the 11th Plan was 3.6, which is more than both the 9th
and 10th Plan levels.
We now see clear indications of
enhanced economic prosperity in our rural areas. In the period 2004 to 2011,
rural per-capita consumption has increased four times faster than earlier.
Rural wages have also increased much
faster in this period. MNREGA provides employment to crores of people in rural
areas. 
Measuring poverty is a difficult task.
There are diverse views about what constitutes poverty. But whatever definition
we may adopt, it cannot be denied that the pace of reduction in poverty has
increased after 2004.
Many States which had been considered
backward for a long time, with some of them being called Bimaru, are now
progressing rapidly.
We have enacted the Right to Education
Act to provide every child in the country the opportunity for education. Almost
all our children are today being imparted education in Primary schools.
The number of young men and women going
to college has more than doubled in the last 9 years.
We have implemented new schemes for
scholarships on a large scale to enable poor children and those belonging to
the weaker sections to access opportunities for education. Today, the Central
government provides scholarships to more than 2 crore children.
Many new institutions have been opened
in the area of Higher education. For example, 8 new IITs, 7 New IIMs, 16 new
Central universities and 10 new NITs. 
New institutions have also been opened to boost scientific research.
Steps have been taken to attract students to the study of science and encourage
Indian scientists working abroad to return to India.
However, much still remains to be done
for reforming our education system.  Many
of our schools still lack drinking water facilities, toilets and other
necessary infrastructure. There is a need to improve the quality of education.
To achieve this, it is necessary to lay more emphasis on training of teachers.
About 11 crore children are being
provided afternoon meals every day in schools under the Mid-day Meal Scheme.
This programme is of immense benefit for both education and nutrition of
children. However, it is necessary to improve its implementation. The tragedy
that happened in Bihar some days back should not be repeated anywhere in the
country.
We had launched the National Rural
Health Mission in 2005. The Mission has started showing good results. Both
Maternal Maternity and Infant Mortality rates have come down sharply. A much
larger proportion of children is now born in hospitals. There has also been a
large increase in the proportion of children being inoculated. 
No case of polio has been detected in
the country in the last two years. We have been able to eradicate a disease
which used to cause disability to lakhs of people.
The Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana,
which provides free in-patient treatment in hospitals to our poor brothers and
sisters, now covers about 3.5 crore families.
We have implemented the Health Mission
in urban areas also. This will result in both expansion and improvement of
health services in such areas.
For ensuring better safety and security
for women, we have strengthened the law dealing with offences against
women.  
There has been good progress in the
last 9 years in the infrastructure sector also, covering areas such as Roads,
Railways, Power, Civil Aviation, Ports and Telecommunications. About 2 lakh km
of new roads have been constructed for connecting villages under the Pradhan
Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana.  More than
37,000 km of new Highways have been built, facilitating travel and trade. More
than 40 airports have been built or upgraded. 
In 2004, only 7 percent of the people had telephone connections. Today,
73 percent enjoy this facility. In rural areas, this figure has gone up from 2
to 40. There has been a record addition to our capacity for electricity
generation.
Brothers
and Sisters,
In the recent months, there has been
much discussion on the fact that last year our growth rate came down to 5
percent. This is indeed true and we are trying our best to remedy the
situation. However, it is not only our country that is facing economic
difficulties. The last year has been difficult for the world economy as a
whole. Major European nations are experiencing a slowdown these days. All over
the world, there has been a slump in export markets. All developing countries
have slowed down.
I believe that this phase of slow
growth in India will not last long. In the last 9 years, our economy has grown
at an annual average rate of 7.9 percent. This pace of development is the
highest in any decade so far.
Brothers
and Sisters,
Countries today are more integrated
with each other than ever before. We have endeavoured that our foreign policy
exploits this fully to India’s benefit. In the last 9 years, there has been a
continuous improvement in our relations with the major powers of the world. Our
Look East policy in respect of 10 ASEAN countries in East and South-East Asia
has borne good results, especially in economic matters. We have also strived
for friendship with our neighbouring countries. However, for relations with
Pakistan to improve, it is essential that they prevent the use of their
territory and territory under their control for any anti-India activity.
There has been improvement in the area
of national security also. Despite some worrisome communal incidents in 2012
and this year, the last 9 years have been good for communal harmony. There has
been a reduction in terrorist and Naxal violence also. However, the area of
national security calls for constant vigil. We have not been successful in
preventing Naxal attacks that happen from time to time. The Naxal violence in
Chhatisgarh on 25 May was a frontal attack on our democracy. Recently, there
was a dastardly attack on our Jawans on the Line of Control with Pakistan. We
will take all possible steps to prevent such incidents in the future.
Brothers
and Sisters,
We have taken many important measures
to make the work of the government responsive, transparent and honest. I would
like to mention only two of them here.
Through the RTI Act, the common man now
gets more information than ever before about the work of the government. This
legislation is being used on a large scale at all levels. The Act frequently
brings to light irregularities and corruption and opens the door for
improvements. I am sure that the RTI will lead to further improvements in the
way the government functions.
We have introduced the Lokpal Bill in
Parliament. The Lok Sabha has passed the Bill and it is now before the Rajya
Sabha. This legislation will be a major step towards making our political
system clean.
Brothers
and Sisters,
We have journeyed a large distance in
the last decade. But much remains to be done. The process of change that we
have initiated will be continued in the coming time.
As I have stated earlier also, rapid
economic growth is an imperative for our country. Without it, we cannot
possibly achieve targets such as removal of poverty, provision of good quality
education and health services and creation of new employment opportunities. The
average rate of economic growth that we have attained in the last 9 years shows
what we are capable of. However, economic growth has slowed down at present and
we are working hard to remedy the situation.
We have recently taken many steps to
speed up the process of government clearances for industry, build an
environment more conducive to trade and industry and increase investment in the
economy. A special Cell has been set up to help big projects with clearances.
The Cabinet Committee on Investment is working to remove hindrances in the way
of stalled projects.
Inadequate supply of coal had become a
major problem affecting our efforts for increasing electricity generation. This
has been resolved to a large extent.
We will start work on a number of new
infrastructure projects in the coming months. This includes 2 new ports, 8 new
airports, new industrial corridors and Rail projects.
To boost Foreign Direct Investment, we
have recently enhanced the limit of such investment in many sectors and made
its easier procedurally.
In the coming months, we will see
visible results of these efforts to increase investment. Our growth will
accelerate, new employment opportunities will be generated and there will be
improvements in the infrastructure sector.
Brothers
and Sisters,
After the enactment of the Food
Security legislation, its implementation will be one of our priorities. We have
already started working in this direction in partnership with States.
Computerization of the Public Distribution System will be speeded up.
The Mid-day Meal scheme will be
reformed. The meals being provided to our children should not only be
nutritious but also be cooked hygienically. We will take concrete measures to
ensure this.
In the area of Skill Development, we
could not initially achieve as much progress as we wanted. But now the pace has
picked up. We have established the National Skill Development Authority a few
months back. We will shortly launch a new scheme under which those who have
successfully acquired new skills will be given a grant of about Rupees 10,000.  This scheme will benefit about 10 lakh young
men and women in the next 12 months.  
The Multi Sectoral Development
Programme for minorities has been reformed recently. We will now implement it
effectively.
A scheme for offering Minimum Support
Prices for minor forest produce has been approved some days back. This will
enable our tribal brothers and sisters to get remunerative prices for the minor
forest produce they collect. We will implement the scheme expeditiously.
A High Level Committee has been
constituted to collect accurate information about the socio-economic,
educational and health status of our tribal population. The report of the
Committee will help us in designing better schemes for their benefit.
We can solve many of the problems that
our country faces by deploying advanced technology. The Aadhaar scheme is a
good example. Under the scheme, by the end of this year, about 50 crore people
will acquire the means of proving their identity and this will bring them
convenience in their daily lives. It will also enable crores of people to avail
of banking facilities for the first time.
Brothers
and Sisters,
There can be no place for narrow and
sectarian ideologies in a modern, progressive and secular country. Such ideologies
divide out society and weaken our democracy. We should prevent them from
growing. We need to strengthen those traditions of our country which teach us
to promote tolerance and respect for thought processes different from ours. I
would appeal to all political parties, all sections of our society and the
public at large to work in this direction.
Brothers
and Sisters,
I had stated a few minutes back that
every decade after independence has witnessed major changes in our country. We
need to think today what changes we would like to see in the decade ahead.
If in the future we can achieve the
same kind of progress as in the last decade, the day is not far off when India
will be rid of poverty, hunger, disease and ignorance. Our India will be
prosperous and all its citizens will be equal partners in this prosperity,
irrespective of their religion, caste, region or language.
We will also need to build an
environment of political stability, social cohesion and security for this to
happen.
Let us all re-dedicate ourselves to
building such an India together.
Dear children, please repeat with me
thrice: Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind.”

2014,"
 
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi addressed the nation from the
ramparts of the Red Fort on the 68th Independence Day.
Following is the English rendering of the Prime Minister’s address
on the occasion:
 
 
            My dear countrymen, 
            Today, all Indians in the country and also abroad are
celebrating the festival of independence. On this day of sacred festival of
independence, the prime servant of India extends greetings to all dear
countrymen.
            I am present amidst you not as the Prime Minister, but
as the Prime Servant. The freedom struggle was fought for so many years, so
many generations laid down their lives, innumerable people sacrificed their
lives and youth, spent their entire lives behind bars. Today, I pay my respect,
greetings and homage to all those who laid their lives for the country's
independence. 
            I also pay my respects to the crores of citizens of this
country on the pious occasion of India's independence, and recall all those
martyrs who had laid down their lives in India's struggle for freedom. The day
of independence is a festival when we take a solemn pledge of working for the
welfare of mother India, and also for the welfare of the poor, oppressed,
dalits, the exploited & the backward people of our country.
            My dear countrymen, a national festival is an occasion
to refine and rebuild the national character. This National
festival inspires us to resolve ourselves to lead a life where our character
gets refined further, to dedicate ourselves to the nation and our every
activity is linked to the interest of the nation and only then this festival of
freedom can be a festival of inspiration to take India to newer heights. 
My dear countrymen, this nation has neither been built by political
leaders nor by rulers nor by governments. This nation has been built by our
farmers, our workers, our mothers and sisters, our youth. The country has
reached here today because of generation to generation rigours undertaken by
our sages, our saints, our maestros, our teachers, our scientists and social
workers. These great people and these great generations, who had worked for the
country throughout their lives, deserve our deepest respect. This is the beauty
of India's Constitution, this is its capability which has made it possible that
today a boy from small town, a poor family has got the opportunity to pay
homage to the tri-colour of India at the ramparts of Lal Quila (Red
Fort). This is the strength of India's democracy. This is an invaluable legacy
which we have inherited from our architects of the constitution. I pay my
respects to those architects of the constitution of India today.
Brothers and sisters, today if we have
reached here after independence, it is because of the contribution of all the
Prime Ministers, all the governments and even the governments of all the States.
I want to express my feelings of respect and gratitude to all those previous
governments and ex-Prime Ministers who have endeavoured to take our present day
India to such heights and who have added to the country's glory.
            This country has been built on such foundation of
ancient cultural heritage, where we were told of only one mantra during Vedic
period, which is indicative of our work culture, which we have learnt, we have
memorized – “Sangachchhdhvam Samvadadhvam sam wo manansi jaanataam.” We
walk together, we move together, we think together, we resolve together and
together we take this country forward. Having imbibed
this basic mantra, 125 crores of countrymen have taken the nation forward.
Yesterday only the first Parliamentary Session of the new Government had
concluded. Today, I can proudly say that the Session of Parliament reflects our
thinking and it is a reflection of our intentions. We are not for moving
forward on the basis of majority, we are not interested to move forward by
virtue of majority. We want to move ahead on the basis of strong consensus. ""Sangachhadhwam""
and, therefore, the nation has witnessed the entire Session of Parliament.
Having taken all the Parties and Opposition along while working shoulder to
shoulder, we achieved an unprecedented success and the credit for this does not
go to the Prime Minister alone, the credit does not go to the people sitting in
the Government, the credit for this goes to the Opposition also, the credit
goes to all the leaders of Opposition too and also all the Members from
Opposition. From the ramparts of Red Fort, quite proudly I salute all the
Members of Parliament, I also salute all the Political Parties and by virtue of
their strong support, we could take some important decisions intended to take
the nation forward and yesterday the Session of Parliament had concluded. 
Brothers and sisters, I am an outsider for Delhi, I am not a native
of Delhi. I have no idea about the administration and working of this place. I
have been quite isolated from the elite class of this place but during the last
two months while being an outsider, I had an insider view and I was astonished.
It is not a political platform, rather it is a platform of a national policy
and, therefore, my views should not be evaluated from a political perspective. I have already said, I salute all the ex-Prime Ministers and
earlier governments who have brought the country thus far. But I am going to
say something else and it may not be seen from political point of view. When I
came to Delhi and noticed an insider view, I felt what it was and I was
surprised to see it. It seemed as if dozens of separate governments are running
at the same time in one main government. It appeared that everyone has its own
fiefdom. I could observe disunity and conflict among them. One department is
taking on the other department and taking on to the extent that two departments
of the same government are fighting against each other by approaching Supreme
Court.This disunity, this conflict among people of the same country! How
come we can take the country forward? And that is why I have started making
efforts for razing those walls; I have started making efforts at making the
Government,  not an assembled entity, but an organic unity, an organic entity,
a harmonious whole- with one aim, one mind, one direction, one energy. Let's
resolve to steer the country to one destination. We have it in us to move in
that direction. A few days back...Nowadays newspapers are full of news that
Modiji's Government has come, officers are reaching office on time, offices
open in time, and people get there in time. I observed that India's National
newspapers, TV media were carrying these news items prominently. As the Head of
the Government I could have derived pleasure in the fact that everything
started going on time, cleanliness got the attention, but I was not taking
pleasure, I was feeling pained. That thing, I want to tell today in public. And
why, because if government officers arrive office in time, does that make a
news? And if that makes news, it shows how low we have fallen. It becomes a
proof of that, and that's how, brothers and sisters, the governments have run?
Today  in the face of global competition,  when we have to realize the dreams
of millions of Indians,  the country cannot run on the lines of "" it
happens"", "" it goes"". In order to fulfil the aspirations of
masses, we have to sharpen the tool called the Government machinery, we have to
make it keen, more dynamic, and it is in this direction that we are 
working. My countrymen, it's not long since I have come from
outside Delhi, but I give you an assurance that the people in the Government
are very capable - from the peon to the Cabinet Secretary, everybody is
capable, everybody has a power, they have experience. I want to awaken that
power, I want to unite that power and want to accelerate the pace of the
welfare of nation through that power and I shall definitely do it. I want to
assure the countrymen that we will achieve that, we will definitely do that. I
could not say this on 16th May, but today after my experience of
two-two and half months, keeping the tricolor as witness, I am saying on 15th
of August that it is possible, it will be achieved.
            Brothers and sisters, time has come to give a serious
thought to the fact that whether we have a duty to create India of the dreams
of those great people who gave us freedom, whether we have a national
character?  
Brothers and sisters, can someone please tell me as to whether he or
she has ever introspected in the evening after a full day's work as to whether
his or her acts have helped the poor of the country or not, whether his or her
actions have resulted in safeguarding the interest of the country or not,
whether the actions have been directed in country's welfare or not? Whether it
should not be the motto of one and a quarter billion countrymen that every step
in life should be in the country's interests? Unfortunately, we have an
environment today wherein if you approach anyone with some work, he begins by
saying ""what does it mean for me?"" He begins by saying ""what
does it involve for me?"" and when he come to know that it does not entail
any benefit for him, immediately he says ""why should I bother?"" we
have to rise above the feelings of ""what does it mean for me"" and
""why should I bother"". Everything is not for self interest only.
There are certain things which are meant for the country and we have to refine
this national character. We have to rise above the feelings of ""why should
I bother"" and ""what does it mean for me"" and instead we have to
think that ""I am for nation's interest and in this field, I am going to
lead"". We have to inculcate this sentiment. 
            Brothers and sisters, when we hear about the incidents
of rape, we hang our heads in shame. People come out with different arguments,
someone indulges in psycho analysis, but brothers and sisters, today from this
platform, I want to ask those parents, I want to ask every parent that you have
a daughter of 10 or 12 years age, you are always on the alert, every now and
then you keep on asking where are you going, when would you come back, inform
immediately after you reach. Parents ask their
daughters hundreds of questions, but have any parents ever dared to ask their
son as to where he is going, why he is going out, who his friends are. After
all, a rapist is also somebody's son. He also has parents. As parents, have we
ever asked our son as to what he is doing and where he is going. If every
parent decides to impose as many restrictions on the sons as have been imposed
on our daughters, try to do this with your sons, try to ask such questions of
them. 
My dear brothers and sisters, the law will take its own course,
strict action will be taken, but as a member of the society, as parents, we
also have some responsibilities. If somebody tells me that those who have taken
guns on their shoulders and kill innocent people are maoists, are terrorists,
but they are also somebody's children. I would like to ask of such parents if
they had ever asked their children as to why they were taking a wrong path.
Every parent must take this responsibility, he must know that his misguided son
is bent on killing innocent people. He is not able to serve himself nor his
family nor the country. I want to say to those youngsters who have chosen the
path of violence that whatever they are and wherever they are, it is all
because of mother India only that they have got it. Whoever you are it is all
because of your parents. I want to ask you to think how green, how beautiful
and how beneficial this earth can become if you shoulder the plough instead of
the gun which spills blood on this land. How long shall we have bloodshed on
this land, how long shall we take the lives of the innocent people and what
have we got after all this? The path of violence has not yielded anything to
us.
            Brothers and sisters, I had gone to Nepal recently.
There I said something publicly to draw the attention of the whole world. There
was a time when the Emperor Ashoka who had chosen the path of wars, got
converted to the path of Buddha at the sight of violence. There was a time in
Nepal when their youngsters had opted for the path of violence but today I
witness that the same youngsters are waiting for their constitution. The same
people associated with them are framing the constitution. And I further said
that if Nepal could present the best example of moving from the weapons to the
books then it could provide inspiration to the youngsters in the world to abandon
the path of violence. 
            Brothers and sisters, If Nepal, land of Budha, can give
message to the world then why can't India too do the same? So it's the call of
the hour that we renounce the path of violence and take the path of
brotherhood.
 Brothers and sisters, for one reason or the other, we have had
communal tensions for ages. This led to the division of the country. Even after
Independence, we have had to face the poison of casteism and communalism. How
long these evils will continue? Whom does it benefit? We have had enough of
fights, many have been killed. Friends, look behind and you will find that
nobody has benefited from it. Except casting a slur on Mother India, we have
done nothing. Therefore, I appeal to all those people that whether it is the
poison of casteism, communalism, regionalism, discrimination on social and
economic basis, all these are obstacles in our way forward. Let's resolve for
once in our hearts, let's put a moratorium on all such activities for ten
years, we shall march ahead to a society which will be free from all such tensions.
And you will see that how much strength we get from peace, unity, goodwill and
brotherhood. Let's experiment it for once. 
My
dear countrymen, believe in my words, I do assure you. Shun all the sins
committed so far, give up that way, follow the way of goodwill and brotherhood,
and let's resolve to take the country forward. I believe we can do that.
With
advancement of science, brothers and sisters, we have a  rising feeling of
modernity in our mind, but what do we do? Have we ever thought what the sex
ratio in the country is like? 940 girls are born against per thousand boys. Who
is causing this imbalance in the society? Certainly not God. I request the
doctors not to kill the girl growing in the womb of a mother just to line their
own pockets.  I advise mothers and sisters not to sacrifice daughters in the
hope of son. Sometimes mother-father feel tempted to have son in the hope of
supporting them in old age. I am a person who has worked in public life. I have
come across families with five sons, each having bungalows, access to fleet of
cars, but parents are forced to live in old-age homes, Vriddhashrams.  I have
seen such families. I have also seen families with only daughter as progeny,
that daughter sacrifices her dreams, doesn't get married, and spends entire
life in taking care of old parents.  This disparity points to female foeticide
and the polluted and tainted mind the 21st century has. We will have
to liberate from it, and that is message to us of this Freedom festival.  
Recently
Commonwealth Games were organized. Indian sportspersons brought glory to the
country. Nearly 64 of our sportspersons won. Our sportspersons brought 64
medals. But of them 29 are girls. Let's feel proud and clap for them. Girls
also contribute to India's fame and glory. Let's recognise it. Let's take them
along, shoulder to shoulder. This way we can get over the evils that have crept
in social life. Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have to proceed in that
direction as a social and national character. Brothers and Sisters, Development
is the only way forward for the country. Good governance is the only way. There
are only these two tracks to take the country forward - good governance and
development, we can move forward only by taking them with us. We wish to move forward
with the intent of taking them with us. When I talk of good
governance, you tell me, when I ask a person in private job, he tells that he
does the job; when you ask the same from a person in government job, he says
that I do the service. Both earn, but for one it is job while for the other it
is service. I ask a question from all brothers and sisters in government
service, whether the word “Service” has not lost its strength, its identity?
Persons in government service are not doing “job”, they are doing “service”. We
have to revive this feeling, we have to take this feeling forward as a national
character, we have to move forward in this direction. 
            Brothers and Sisters, whether the citizens of the
country should take steps for the welfare of the nation or not? You imagine, if
this 125 crores of countrymen move one step forward, then the country moves 125
crore steps forward. The meaning of democracy is not just limited to electing a
government, but its meaning is that 125 crore of citizens work together joining
shoulder with the government to fulfill hopes and aspirations of the country,
this is the meaning of democracy. We have to create partnership with the
people. We have to proceed under Public-Private
Partnership. We have to proceed along with the participation of the people.
But, please tell me why our farmers commit suicide? A farmer takes loan from
the moneylender, but fails to repay his loans. He takes loan for the wedding of
his daughter, but fails to repay. He will have to suffer hardships during his
whole life. He chooses to commit suicide. Who will save the poor families of
such farmers? 
Brothers and sisters, I have come here with a pledge to launch a
scheme on this festival of Freedom. It will be called 'Pradhanmantri
Jan-Dhan Yojana'. I wish to connect the poorest citizens of the country
with the facility of bank accounts through this yojana. There are
millions of families who have mobile phones but no bank accounts. We have to
change this scenario. Economic resources of the country should be utilized for
the well-being of the poor. The change will commence from this point. This yojana
will open the window. Therefore, an account holder under 'Pradhanmantri
Jan-Dhan Yojana' will be given a debit card. An insurance of One Lakh
Rupees will be guaranteed with that debit card for each poor family, so that
such families are covered with the insurance of One Lakh Rupees in case of any
crisis in their lives.
  My brothers and sisters, it is a country of young people. The 65
percent population of the country happens to be under the age of 35 years. Our
country has the largest number of youths in the world. Have we ever thought of
deriving an advantage out of it? Today, the world needs a skilled workforce.
Today, India also needs a skilled workforce. At times, we look for a good
driver but he is not available, we look for a plumber, but he is not available.
If we need a good cook, he is not available. We have young people, they are
unemployed but the kind of young people we seek for are not available. If we
have to promote the development of our country then our mission has to be
'skill development' and 'skilled India'. Millions and Millions of Indian youth
should go for acquisition of skills and there should be a network across the
country for this and not the archaic systems. They should acquire the skills
which could contribute towards making India a modern country. Whenever they go
to any country in the world, their skills must be appreciated and we want to go
for a two pronged development. I also want to create a pool of young people who
are able to create jobs and the ones who are not capable of creating jobs and
do not have the opportunities, they must be in a position to face their
counterparts in any corner of the world while keeping their heads high by
virtue of their hard work and their dexterity of hands and win the hearts of
people around the world through their skills. We want to go for the capacity
building of such young people. My brothers and sisters, having taken a resolve
to enhance the skill development at a highly rapid pace, I want to accomplish
this.
            Brothers and sisters, the world has undergone a change.
My dear countrymen, the world has changed. Now India can not decide its future
by remaining isolated and sitting alone in a corner. The economics of the world
have changed and, therefore, we will have to act accordingly. Government have
taken many decisions recently, made some announcements in the budget and I call
upon the world and call upon the Indians spread world over that if we have to
provide more and more employment to the youth, we will have to promote
manufacturing sector. If we have to develop a balance between imports and
exports, we will have to strengthen manufacturing sector. If we have to put in
use the education, the capability of the youth, we will have to go for
manufacturing sector and for this Hindustan also will have to lend its full
strength, but we also invite world powers. Therefore I want to appeal all the
people world over, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, ""Come, make in
India"", ""Come, manufacture in India"". Sell in any country of the
world but manufacture here. We have got skill, talent, discipline, and
determination to do something. We want to give the world an favourable
opportunity that come here, ""Come, Make in India"" and we will say to
the world, from electrical to electronics, ""Come, Make in India"",
from automobiles to agro value addition ""Come, Make in India"", paper
or plastic, ""Come, Make in India"", satellite or submarine ""Come,
Make in India"". Our country is powerful. Come, I am giving you an
invitation. 
            Brothers
and sisters, I want to call upon the youth of the country, particularly the small
people engaged in the industrial sector. I want to call upon the youth working
in the field of technical education in the country. As I say to the world
""Come, Make in India"", I say to the youth of the country - it should
be our dream that this message reaches every corner of the world, ""Made in
India"". This should be our dream. Whether, to serve the country, is it necessary for the youth of the country to be hanged like
Bhagat Singh? Brothers and sisters, Lal Bahadur Shastri had given the slogan
""Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan"". A soldier sacrifices himself
at the border and protects Mother India. Similarly, a farmer serves Mother
India by filling the godowns with grains. This is also nation's service.
Filling the granary is the biggest nation's service that a farmer provides.
That is why Lal Bahadur Shashtri had given the slogan of ""Jai Jawan, Jai
Kisan"". 
Brothers and Sisters, I would like to pose a question to my
youngsters as to why despite them, we are forced to import even the smallest of
things? My country's youth can resolve it, they should conduct research, try to
find out as to what type of items are imported by India and then each one
should resolve that, through may be micro or small industries only, he would
manufacture atleast one such item so that we need not import the same in
future. We should even advance to a situation wherein we are able to export
such items. If each one of our millions of youngsters resolves to manufacture
atleast one such item, India can become a net exporter of goods. I, therefore,
urge upon the youth, in particular our small entrepreneurs that they would
never compromise, atleast on two counts. First, zero defect and, second again
zero effect. We should manufacture goods in such a way that they carry zero
defect, that our exported goods are never returned to us. We should manufacture
goods with zero effect that they should not have a negative impact on the
environment. If we march ahead with the dream of zero defect in the
manufacturing sector then, my brothers and sisters, I am confident that we
would be able to achieve our goals. 
            Brothers and sisters, the youth of India has completely
transformed the identity of India in the world. Earlier, in what manner did the
world know our country?  Till only 25-30 years back, if not more, there were
many people in the world who thought that India was a country of snake
charmers, it was a country which practiced in black magic. The real identity of
India had not reached the world, but my dear brothers and sisters, our
youngsters, 20-22-23 years old youngsters have mesmerized the whole world with
their skills in computers. Our young I.T. professionals have given a new path
of making a new identity of India. If our country has this strength, can we
think something about the country? Our dream is, therefore, of ""Digital
India"". When I talk of ""Digital India"", I don't speak of the
elite, it is for the poor people. You can imagine what a quality education the children
in villages will get, if all the villages of India are connected with Broadband
Connectivity and if we are able to give long distance education to the schools
in every remote corner of the villages. If we create a network of telemedicine
in the places where there is a shortage of doctors, we can have a clear
guideline of the way in which health facilities have to be provided to the poor
people living in those areas. The citizens of India have mobile phones in their
hands, they have mobile connectivity, but can we walk in the direction of
mobile governance? We have to move in a direction where every poor person is
able to operate his bank account from his mobile, is able to demand various
things from the government, can submit applications, can conduct all his
business, while on the move, through mobile governance and if this has to be
done, we have to move towards 'digital India' and if we have to move towards
'digital India' then we have a dream. Today we are importing electronic goods
on a large scale. Friends, you will be surprised that we are bringing in these
televisions, mobile phones, i-pads and all these electronic goods. It is a
necessity to import petroleum products, oil, diesel and petrol. Second to this
is the import of our electronic goods. If we move ahead with the dream of
'digital India' to manufacture electronic goods and become self reliant at
least there, how big can be the benefit for the treasury! Therefore,
e-governance is what we need to take this idea of 'digital India' forward.
E-governance is easy governance, effective governance and also economic
governance. E-governance paves the way for good governance. There was a time
when we used to say that the railways provided connectivity to the country.
That was it. I say that today it is IT that has the potential to connect each
and every citizen of the country and that is why we want to realise the mantra
of unity with the help of 'digital India'. 
          Brothers
and sisters, if we move ahead with all this then I believe that a 'digital India'
will have the potential to stand with the world on equal footing. Our youth have that capability, it is an opportunity for them.
Brothers and sisters, we want to promote tourism. Tourism provides
employment to the poorest of the poor. Gram seller earns something,
auto-rickshaw driver earns something, pakoda seller earns something and tea
seller also earns something. When there is talk of tea seller, I feel a sense
of belongingness. Tourism provide employment to the poorest of the poor. But
there is a big obstacle in promoting tourism and in our national character and
that is - the filthiness all around us. Whether after independence, after so
many years of independence, when we stand at the threshold of one and half
decade of 21st century, we still want to live in filthiness? The
first work I started here after formation of Government is of cleanliness.
People wondered whether it is a work of a Prime Minister? People may feel that
it is a trivial work for a Prime Minister but for me this a big work. Cleanliness
is very big work. Whether our country can not be clean? If one hundred and
twenty five crore countrymen decide that they will never spread filthiness,
which power in the world has ability to spread filthiness in our cities and
villages? Can't we resolve this much?
Brothers and sisters it will be 150th birth anniversary
of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019. How do we celebrate 150th birth
anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi? Mahatma Gandhi, who gave us freedom, who brought
so much honour to such a big country in the world, what do we give to Mahatma
Gandhi? Brothers and Sisters, Mahatma Gandhi had cleanliness and
sanitation closest to his heart. Whether we resolve not to leave a speck of
dirt in our village, city, street, area, school, temple, hospital, and what have
you,  by 2019 when we celebrate 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi?
This happens not just with the Government, but with public participation.
That's why we have to do it together. 
            Brother
and Sisters, we are living in 21st century. Has it ever pained us
that our mothers and sisters have to defecate in open? Whether dignity of women
is not our collective responsibility? The poor womenfolk of the village wait
for the night; until darkness descends, they can't go out to defecate. What
bodily torture they must be feeling, how many diseases that act might engender.
Can't we just make arrangements for toilets for the dignity of our mothers and
sisters? Brothers and Sisters, somebody might feel that a big festival like 15th
August is an occasion to talk big. Brothers and Sisters, talking big has its
importance, making announcements too has importance, but sometimes
announcements raise hopes and when the hopes are not fulfilled, the society
sinks into a state of despondency. That's why are in favour of telling those
things, which we can fulfil just within our sight. Brothers
and sisters, you must be getting shocked to hear the Prime Minister speaking of
cleanliness and the need to build toilets from the ramparts of the Red Fort. Brothers
and sisters, I do not know how my speech is going to be criticised and how will
people take it. But this is my heartfelt conviction. I come from a poor family,
I have seen poverty. The poor need respect and it begins with cleanliness. I,
therefore, have to launch a 'clean India' campaign from 2nd October this year
and carry it forward in 4 years. I want to make a beginning today itself and
that is - all schools in the country should have toilets with separate toilets
for girls. Only then our daughters will not be compelled to leave schools
midway. Our parliamentarians utilizing MPLAD fund are there. I appeal to them
to spend it for constructing toilets in schools for a year. The government
should utilise its budget on providing toilets. I call upon the corporate
sector also to give priority to the provision of toilets in schools with your
expenditure under Corporate Social Responsibility. This target should be
finished within one year with the help of state governments and on the next 15th
August, we should be in a firm position to announce that there is no school in
India without separate toilets for boys and girls. 
Brothers and sisters, if we proceed with the dreams, we are in a
position to realise them. Today, I wish to tell one more specific thing. It has
its own importance to discuss the matters and express the views of nation's
interest. However, our Members of Parliament do not get
opportunity though they are willing to do something. They can express
themselves, write to the government, agitate, give memoranda. Still they do not
get opportunity to do something on their own. Today I have come to you with a
new idea. We are running so many schemes in the name of the Prime Minister in
our country, there are numerous schemes in the name of various leaders.
However, today I am going to announce a scheme on behalf of the Member of
Parliament- 'Sansad Aadarsh Gram Yojana'. We
shall fix some parameters. I urge upon the Members of Parliament to select any
one of the villages having population of three to five thousand in your
constituency. The parameters will be according to the time, space and situation
of that locality. It will include the conditions of health, cleanliness,
atmosphere, greenery, cordiality etc. On the basis of those parameters, each of
our MPs should make one village of his or her constituency a Model Village by
2016. Can't we do at least this? Shouldn't we do this? If we have to build a
nation, we should start from the village. Make a Model Village. The reason of
fixing this target for 2016 is that it is a new scheme. It takes time to
formulate a scheme and then to implement it. After 2016, select two more
villages for this purpose, before we go for the General Elections in 2019. And after 2019, each Member of Parliament, during his/her tenure of
5 years must establish at-least five model villages in his/her area. I also
call upon the Members of Parliament from urban areas to adopt one village of
their choice. I also urge upon the Members of Parliament from Rajya Sabha to
adopt one of the villages. If we provide one model village in each district of
India then the surrounding villages shall be automatically inspired to follow
that model. Let us establish a model village, let us establish a village well
equipped with all systems and facilities. The birth anniversary of Jai Prakash
Narayan Ji happens to be on 11th October. On 11th
October, the occasion of birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narayan Ji, I will
present a complete blueprint of ""Sānsad Adharsh Grām Yojana"" (Members of Parliament
Model Village Scheme) before all Members of Parliament and State Governments, and
I urge upon State Governments also that as per the feasibility in their
respective states, all the Members of Legislative Assembly resolve to establish
a model village. You can imagine all the Members of Legislative Assembly and
all the Members of Parliament in the country establishing a model village. All
of a sudden, there would be a model village in each block of India which could
inspire us to transform the amenities in rural areas and could give us a new
direction and, therefore, we want to move ahead under this ""Sānsad Adarsh Grām Yojana"".
            My dear brothers and sisters, ever since our government
has taken charge, there has been a discussion in the newspapers, on T.V.
channels as to what would happen to Planning Commission. I believe that when
Planning Commission was constituted, it was done on the basis of the
circumstances and the needs of those times. In recent years, Planning
Commission has contributed to the growth of the country in its own way. I
respect that, I am proud of that, but the prevalent situation in the country is
different, global scenario has also changed, governments are no longer the
centre of economic activities, the scope of such activities has broadened. State governments have been at the center
of development and I consider this a good indication. If we have to take
India forward, it can happen only by taking the states forward.  India's
federal structure is more important today than in the last 60 years. To
strengthen our federal structure, to make our federal structure vibrant, to
take our federal structure as a heritage of development, a team of Chief
Minister and Prime Minister should be there, a joint team of the Centre and the
states should move forward, then to do this job, we will have to think about
giving the Planning Commission a look. So, I am saying from the rampart of the
Red Fort that it is a very old system and it will have to be rejuvenated, it
will have to be changed a lot. Sometimes it costs more to repair the old house, but,
it gives us no satisfaction. Thereafter, we have a feeling that it would be
better to construct a new house altogether and therefore within a short period,
we will replace the planning commission with a new institution having a new
design and structure, a new body, a new soul, a new thinking, a new direction,
a new faith towards forging a new direction to lead the country based on
creative thinking, public-private partnership, optimum utilization of
resources, utilization of youth power of the nation, to promote the aspirations
of state governments seeking development, to empower the state governments and
to empower the federal structure. Very shortly, we are about to move in a
direction when this institute would be functioning in place of Planning
Commission. 
Brothers and sisters, today, on 15th August, we also have
the birth anniversary of Maharishi Aurobindo. Maharishi Aurobindo, being a
rebel, moved on to achieve the status of a Yoga Guru. With regard to the
destiny of India, he remarked, ""I have a faith that the divine power and
spiritual heritage of India will play an important role towards the welfare of
the world."" Such sentiments were echoed by
Maharishi Arvind. I strongly believe in the words of legends. I have great
faith in the statements made by ascetics, sages & saints and that’s why
today at the ramparts of Lal Quila I am reminded of the words of Swami
Viveknanda. He had said - ""I can see before my eyes Mother India awakening
once again. My Mother India would be seated as the World Guru. Every Indian
would render service towards welfare of humanity. This legacy of India would be
useful for the welfare of the world"". These words were spoken by Swami
Viveknanda ji in his own style. Friends, the words of Viveknanda ji can never
be untrue. The words of Viveknanda ji, his dream of seeing India ensconced as
World Guru, his vision, it is incumbent upon us to realize that dream. This
capable country, blessed with natural bounty, this country of youth can do much
for the world in the coming days.
            Brothers and sisters, our foreign policy is a much talked about issue. I clearly believe
that India's foreign policy can be multi-dimensional. But there is an important
issue to which I want to draw your attention that the way we fought for
freedom, we fought together, we were not separate at that time. We were
together. Which was the government with us? What were the weapons available to
us? There was a Gandhi, a Sardar and lakhs of freedom fighters and such a huge
empire. Didn't we win in the struggle of freedom against that empire? Did we
not defeat the foreign powers? Did we not force them to leave India? We were
the ones, they were our ancestors only who showed this might. If the people of
India could remove such a big empire without the power of the government,
without weapons and even without resources, then friends, it is the need of the
hour to eradicate poverty, can we not overcome poverty? Can we not defeat
poverty? My 125 crore dear countrymen, let us resolve to eradicate poverty, to
win against it. Let us move with the dream of poverty eradication from India.
Our neighbouring countries are also faced with the same problem. Why not get
together with all the SAARC nations to plan out the fight against poverty?
Let's fight together and defeat poverty. Let us see at-least for once as to how
wonderful is the feeling of being alive instead of killing and getting killed. This
is the land where incidents from Siddharth's life happened. One bird was shot
with an arrow by one brother and the other took out that arrow to save it. They
went to mother- whose bird, whose swan? Whether killer's or saviour's, they
asked of mother. The mother replied, saviour's. The saviour has more power than
the killer and that makes him Buddha in future. And that's why I seek
cooperation from neighbouring countries for fighting against poverty in concert
and cooperate with them, so that together with SAARC countries we can create
our importance and emerge as a power in the world. It is imperative that we
work together with a dream to win a fight against poverty, shoulder to
shoulder. I went to Bhutan, Nepal, all the dignitaries from SAARC countries
took part in oath-taking ceremony; this marked a good beginning. This will
definitely yield good results, it is my belief and this thinking of India, in
the country and the world, that we want to do well to the countrymen and be
useful for the welfare of the world, India wants such a hand to be extended. We
are trying to move forward with these dreams to achieve them.
Brothers
and Sisters, today on 15th August we will resolve to do something
for the country. Let's be useful for the country, we will move ahead with a
resolve to take the country forward, and I assure you, Brothers and Sisters, as
well as my colleagues in the Government, that if you work for 12 hours, I will
do so for 13 hours. If you work for 14 hours, I will do for 15 hours. Why?
Because I'm amidst you not as a Prime Minister, but as the first servant. I
have formed the Government not as a ruler, but as a servant. Brothers and
sisters, I assure that this country has a destiny. It is
destined to work for the welfare of the world, it was said by Vivekanand ji.
India is born, this Hindustan is born in order to achieve this destiny. One hundred
and twenty five crore countrymen have to move forward wholeheartedly for the
welfare of the nation. 
            Once again I feel proud of the devotion, the sacrifices
of the security forces of the country, para-military forces of the country, all
the security forces of the country to protect Mother India. I say to the
countrymen, ""राष्ट्रयाम,
जाग्रयाम्
वयम्"", ""Eternal
vigilance is the price of liberty"". The army is vigilant, we should also
be vigilant and the country scales new heights, we have to move forward with
this resolution. Speak loudly with me with full force -
Bharat mata ki jai, bharat mata ki jai, bharat mata ki jai.
Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind.
Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram!

                English rendering of PM’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 69th Independence Day

Prime Minister: My Beloved 125 Crore countrymen of India,
My best wishes and heartiest greetings on the occasion of this sacred festival of our Freedom. This morning of the 15th of August is not a usual morning. This is the dawn of the freedom-festival of the greatest democracy of the world. This dawn is also the dawn of the dreams of the one hundred twenty five Crore Indian Citizens. This dawn also heralds the resolve of 125 Crore people of India. On this pious occasion I also extend my many many salutations to all those great persons of India who sacrificed their lives and led a life of penance while making persistent efforts to fight for the honour of the country. They even spent their youth in the prison, went through all kinds of sufferings; but never gave up their dreams and resolve to see India free.
Recently many distinguished citizens of India, youths, literary artists and social workers- sons and daughters of Mother India- have achieved many great feats to make our country proud. They are countless in number and from the ramparts of Red fort I extend my best wishes and greetings to all of them from the core of my heart. 
The vastness and the diversity of India is always talked about, but Our India has many other great characteristics as well, there is a lot of diversity in India. India is a large country. And there is simplicity among the people of India. There is unity running through all the parts of the country and that is what is our strength; the strength of our nation. Strength of our country has been sustained over centuries together. Every era has seen the attempts to boost it further. They have been moulded according to the requirements of realising the dreams for the future, they have been nurtured and it is due to that only that this country has reached this far with our age old traditions and ever new resolves. Our unity, simplicity, fraternity, harmony are our biggest strength. This strength should never be blemished, it should never be hit. If the unity of the country gets disturbed, the dreams also get shattered, therefore, whether it is the poison of casteism, communal fanaticism, we don’t have to allow it in any form whatsoever, not allow it to take root, and then we have to cure the poison of casteism, the fanaticism of communalism with the nectar of development, distribute the flow of the nectar of development and through the flow of this nectar attempt bringing about a new awareness. 
	Dear brothers and sisters, this country is moving ahead because of the ""Team India"" and this ""Team India"" is a big team of our one twenty five crore countrymen. The world might never have thought about the team of one twenty five crore citizens working as a team together as to how they take the nation to new heights, build the nation and also protect it!  So, whatever we are doing and wherever we are trying to reach, it is all because of the ""Team India"" and we are grateful to this ""Team India"". People’s participation is the biggest strength of democracy.  If we run the country through the participation of One Hundred and twenty five crore Indians, our country will be moving ahead one hundred and twenty five crore steps every moment. That is why we have encouraged this people's participation as ""Team India"". We have given priority to ""Team India"". Through electronic platform mygov.in, through lacs of letters of the countrymen, through my Mann Ki Baat, through dialogues with citizens, this people’s participation is on the rise day by day. About every affair of the Government we receive a number of suggestions from the far flung villages of our country and this is the real strength of our ""Team India"".
	My dear fellow citizens, this is a fact that there is only one mandate of this ""Team India"" and that is all our schemes, all our systems should benefit the poor of the country. We should support the poor in their fight against poverty and empower them in this arduous effort of theirs because no one wants to remain poor and they also wish to get rid of poverty. Hence the meaningfulness of our resources, our schemes and our programmes is in their usefulness to the cause of welfare of the poor. 
	Brothers and sisters, last year on the occasion of 15th of August, I had expressed some of my views before you. At that time I was new, whatever I saw in the government, I expressed them with an open mind  before one hundred and twenty five crore citizens. Today after one year, standing under the Tricolor from the same ramparts of the Red Fort , I assure the countrymen that in this period of one year our ""Team India"", consisting of one hundred and twenty five crore people, is committed to realize our dreams  within the timeframe with  new hope, new energy and utmost hard work. An atmosphere of trust has emerged. I had announced ‘Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna’ on the last 15th   of August. Even after sixty years of independence; even when the banks were nationalized for the poor, 40% people of the country were without a bank account till the last 15th of August; the doors of the banks were not open for the poor. We resolved that we would erase this blot and would provide a solid base to the financial inclusion which is talked about the world over, by integrating the poorest of the poor to the mainstream economic activities; and this is only the beginning. We had decided that unlike the previous work culture of talking in terms of uncertain time frames, we will complete the work by the 26th of January as the country celebrates the next Republic Day. 
My countrymen, today I can proudly say that we achieved that target within the time frame. 17 Crore people opened their bank accounts under ‘Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna’. With a view to extend opportunities to the poor, we had said that these bank accounts could be opened with zero balance. We had even said that we would bear the operational costs of the bank. After all, what for the banks exist? They should be for the poor and that’s why we had decided to open accounts with zero balance. We have seen the rich of our country; however, this time around we have also seen our poor and seen their wealth. From the ramparts of the Red Fort, let me salute and bow to the large-heartedness of these poor; because even if there was a provision of opening the account with zero balance, these poor people have deposited twenty thousand crore rupees in their bank accounts. It could be possible only due to richness of our poor citizens. 	And hence, today my conviction bears proof that it is all because of the spirit of these poor that this ""Team India"" will march ahead.
Brothers and sisters, if the branch of a bank is opened or a building of the bank is constructed in a certain part of our country, it becomes the hot topic of discussion, people rejoice, it is hailed as a mark of great development and remarkable progress. This is so because in the past 60 years, we have measured the development of the country only on the basis of these parameters. This has been the yardstick that if any branch of a bank is opened somewhere, it elicits lots of accolades and praises, the Government receives much adulation, but my dear fellow citizens, it is not a challenging task to open a branch of a bank. This task can easily be accomplished through the Government exchequer, but to bring 17 crore countrymen to the doorstep of the bank is an arduous task, it takes a lot of hard work, you have to give your heart and soul to accomplish this task, you are required to be ever vigilant. And here I would extend my heartfelt congratulations to various Banks and their employees who have been a very significant part of ""Team India"". I congratulate them for making banks so easily accessible to the poor and this fact will bring a major change in the coming days.
	Among the global economic schools of thought, there is also the one which maintains that financial inclusion doesn’t always bring positive results and due to that the system has to bear the pressure of poverty. I disagree with this thought. In a country like India, if we look at the pyramid of development, its base is the broadest. If it be firm, the entire pyramid of development tends to be strong. Today the downtrodden, the exploited, oppressed, deprived, and the ignored ones of our country form the base of the pyramid of development. We have to strengthen the foundation of this pyramid of development so as to ensure that these people are empowered through financial inclusion and this pyramid of development remains unshakable. It would stand firm amid any crisis and if this pyramid of development is based on economic strength, it would increase the purchasing power of these people to a great extent. And when the purchasing power of the poorest of the poor in the society increases, nobody can stop that economy to flourish and move ahead. It takes the country swiftly to the newer heights of development and therefore it is our intention to give impetus to that. We have laid great stress upon social security and also the welfare of the poor - and thus Prime Minister's Suraksha Bima Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana and Prime Minister's Jeevan Jyoti Bima yojana have been launched. Crores of the people of our country have no social security cover. Leave the poor aside, benefit of insurance has not reached even the lower middle class.  So we made a plan - just pay one rupee per month, not more, that is just Rs. 12  per annum and be entitled to the benefits of Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana. If  your family faces any calamity then they will receive 2 lac rupees. We know how to manage an economy ! That's why we launched Prime Minister's Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana for 90 paisa a day, even less than 1 rupee. So it is Rs. 330 annually for the health of one's family - and for the security of one's family- insurance of 2 lac rupees. This is what we have done.    
 	Brothers and sisters, schemes have been made in the past also. There is no Government which doesn't make schemes. Every Government does that. There is no government which doesn't make announcements. Every Government does that. There is no government which doesn't light the inauguration lamps, doesn't cut ribbons--every Government does that. But the touchstone is whether we walk the talk or not. We have laid a great stress upon a new work culture. Dear Countrymen, our nation has many schemes which are 40 years old or 50years old but these schemes could not reach more than 5 or 7 crore people. This scheme has just completed a hundred days, 100 days!  I mean it, and in these hundred days ten crore citizens have been benefited 10 crore people! Ten crore citizens of this country means ten crore families. And this means that out of total 30-35 crore families of our country, ten crore families have joined this scheme within a span of hundred days.    
Brothers and sisters, the uniqueness of our government, of ""Team India"", during last one year, especially the great strength and the biggest achievement of ""Team India"", consisting of one hundred and twenty five crore people has been to fulfill the tasks within the set time frame. 
 	Last year I referred to toilet facilities for all from this Red Fort, I also referred to cleanliness. It sounded strange to the whole country for a few hours as to what sort of Prime Minister is this! But today in all the surveys that has been carried out in the entire country, this point  has come out in all of them that if there is something that is the most important factor of ""Team India"" and that has touched every person,  is the movement towards cleanliness. 
Brothers and sisters, we used to invoke the people of the society and marked the names of various people to promote the ""cleanliness drive"". That was such a period, but today I have to congratulate this ""Team India"". People from all walks of life whether they are Celebrities, Diplomats, Social Workers, Educationists, community leaders or spiritual leaders or our friends from media, all of them have taken a major responsibility to train the common man without criticising anybody and without pointing towards the lacunas. Today I greet them all from the core of my heart who have done this job but I only wish to stress upon a point- from whom this ""Swachh Bharat"" drive has gained maximum strength?   Who are its biggest brand ambassador? You may not have paid heed to it, but try to remember what happened in your family? There are crores of such families in India, whose children are in the age group of five, ten and fifteen and they have become the greatest ambassador of ""Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan"". These children prevent their parents from littering in their homes and ask them to avoid spreading filth and rubbish here and there. In case, any father is addicted to consuming gutka and whenever  the father opens the windows of the car to spit, his son prevents him to do so on the plea of keeping India clean. The success of this programme is due to those little children. I wish to bow my head towards the future of my country, I wish to bow my head and greet those children. The fact which is not realized even by the  elite people has been easily understood by the  innocent  children and it is my belief that such a country where a child is so much aware, so committed towards cleanliness, such country is bound to become clean; Abhorrence against filth and dirt is bound to arise there.
 In 2019 we are about to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and on 150th anniversary of Gandhiji we have to handover him ""Swachh Bharat"" as a tribute. There cannot be a greater tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary. The task has just started, but I have to take it forward, not to stop it, not to get satisfied. I had announced such a programme from here, just for a trial, so that I could ascertain whether ""Team India"" is able to do it or not. I had announced it without consulting anybody. It was not announced after collecting relevant information from districts and villages. It just came into my heart and I had announced that we would build separate toilets for boys and girls in all of our schools till the next 15th August. But later on, when we started work, the ""Team India"" figured out its responsibilities, we realised that there were 2 lakh and 62 thousand such schools, where more than 4.25 lakh toilets were required to be built. This figure was so big that any government could rethink to extend the deadline, but it certainly was the resolve of the '""Team India""' that no one sought any extension. Today, on this 15th August, I salute the ""Team India"", who, keeping the honour of our tricolour National Flag, left no stone unturned to realise that dream, and the '""Team India""' has now nearly achieved the target of building all the toilets. I compliment all the state governments, government officers of the districts, policy framers and implementers of educational institutions, who were involved in realising this achievement. This is not just an issue of building more than 4.25 lakh toilets. This is an issue of creating an atmosphere of self-confidence at a time, when we were so engulfed with the negativity that it was being told that nothing could happen, there was no hope, it was not possible. But now, the ""Team India"" has demonstrated that we are ready to accept challenges, we would not withdraw, and we are committed for our success. The nation runs on this self-confidence, the nation runs by realising newer resolutions. We cannot stop anywhere, we have to continuously move forward. Therefore, Brothers and Sisters, we have prepared a plan for the labourers of our country, and it has been named as ""SHRAMEVA JAYATE"". Our attitude towards the poor labourers is not good. 
	If we meet a person wearing coat, pants, tie or we meet a great person wearing long kurta, jacket we salute him by standing in his honour. But if an auto rickshaw driver, pedal rickshaw puller, newspaper vendor or a milkman come to us, our feelings towards these poor men are not proper. One hundred and twenty five crore citizens of the country  have to remove this deficiency of the nation by their resolution of mind. The persons due to whom we look good, who serve us good, no one is our better well wisher than them and therefor, dignity  of labourers, honour of labourers, pride of labourers- this should be our national duty , this should be our national character, this should be the tendency of everyone, nature of everyone. Recently, we started a campaign of issuing special identity card to the unorganized labour falling under certain schemes. They are to get the benefits of many schemes of security through that identity card. These unorganized labourers were never taken care of. Similarly, labourers of our country had deposited their share of hard earned money in Government coffers. Slowly, this amount grew to Rs. 27 thousand crores, but  when that poor labourer moves to some another place after 6-8 months of employment there, moves to another place after a year or two from there, no account  of the money he deposited there is maintained. The amount is also so low that he does not wish to bring back the same by spending two hundred rupees on fare. That is why Rs. 27 thousand crores of poor people of my country, labourers of my country, money earned by them by the sweat of their brow was lying idle in the coffers of the Government. We found a solution to it. We provided a special identity card number to these labourers and told them wherever you are transferred now, even if you move to another place by quitting the job or if you move from one factory to another, from one state to another, you will always retain this number and you will retain your money, no one will be able to misappropriate your single rupee. So, we have tried to return the Rs. 27 thousand crores to the poor.
It has become a fashion in our country- make law for everything and keep our courts busy. One law may contradict the other but the law should be on the same subject. Confusion was being created here always. This is not a good sign for good governance and therefor, law should be explicit, law should be correct, law should not be out of sync with time, only then society progresses.
Where will a poor labourer look for his thing of interest in the pile-up of different types of 44 legislations meant for our labourers? We have brought about a change therein. By incorporating these 44 legislations into four codes of conduct, the poorest of the poor and even an illiterate labourer can know about his or her interest, we have emphasized this scheme. 
Brothers and Sisters, corruption is a much discussed topic in our country. We must have seen an ailing person, habitually, giving tips to others on how to be healthy. He does not care for himself, but it is the nature of every human being to advise others that you do it and you will become healthy and  you do that and you will become healthy. Corruption is also like this. The person involved in it, also advise, the person who is suffering due to it, also advise and thus they advise each other, and this goes on and on. 
Brothers and Sisters, I have never made this announcement, but today I wish to state, I want to assure my fellow countrymen, I want to tell the ""Team India"" comprising 1.25 billion people that this country can become corruption-free. On the basis of experience I am saying this. This job has to be started from the top. Corruption is stuck with our country like a termite and the termite keeps on spreading, initially it is not visible, but when it spreads in our bedroom and reaches the cupboard where clothes are hung, we find that and when we want to get rid of it, insecticides have to be injected per square meter of land. After so many of years of efforts, we get rid of termite. Countless efforts of several types have to be made to wipe out the corruption in such a vast country, and that can be done. If I had said that I would cut subsidy worth Rs. 15 thousand cores on LPG gas, then I can say that hundreds of articles would have been written to glorify my Government. They can say that this man has the power and strength to discontinue the subsidy worth Rs. 15 thousand cores on LPG gas. It is this man who can take tough decision and if it is not done so, then nothing happens my dear friends and nothing is visible. Sometimes people are fond of sinking into despair. Until they talk of despair amongst people they can not sleep at night. 
They have this habit.  There are some ailing people, who do not like to disclose about their  illness and they also do not like to someone inquiring about their ailment.  While there are some others who wait for a particular person to enquire about their health and if he does not visit, they talk about this for hours together. I can see that there are some people who always search for negativism, propagate negativism and they enjoy it as much as they can.  Such people neither have any schemes nor activities, yet ""Team India' consisting of 1.25 billion Indians is ready to invest time for them, but how does that happen?  We have put in place a scheme of Direct Benefit Transfer of LPG subsidy.  Taking advantage of Jan Dhan Accounts and Aadhaar Card we have transferred the subsidy directly into the accounts.  As a result of this the brokers, the middlemen and the blackmarketeers have disappeared.  Only the real beneficiary got the benefit.  Our Government have neither slashed a penny from anyone's benefit nor we have made announcements to earn praise.  We have improved the system and today I wish to inform the 'Team India' of 1.25 billion Indians that as a result of this an amount of Rs.15,000 crore, which was being siphoned off annually in the name of gas cylinders has been stopped.  My countrymen, the corruption has stopped.
My brothers and sisters, you can see how work is done?  We have done it.  Rupees 15,000 crore is not a small amount for a country like India.  We have launched an open website, displayed a board of delivery there, even then if someone has a complaint, he would get a cylinder even at midnight but we cannot permit those who loot the country and poors as well.  Tell me whether this is not a fight against corruption?
My brothers and sisters, I had made a request to my countrymen that if you are economically sound, then why do you avail subsidy on L.P.G?  Why do you need this paltry amount of rupees five to seven hundred which you usually spend on petty snacks.  I had just started giving message about this, I didn't launch any campaign as yet, because I have faith in ""Team India'.  As the message spreads the result would come, but to-day I can tell with pride that ever-since I had launched movement of ""give it up"" subsidy of LPG gas cylinder, till date 20 lakh consumers have already given it up.
 This is not a small figure. Even if we are in the queue before a temple for the blessings (Prasad), we sometimes wish that we should get some of the prasad for our younger brother also. This is in our nature. These 20 lakh people are not from rich or wealthy families. They are all from the common middle class. Some teacher may have been a pensioner, but when he learnt that this LPG cylinder may go to some poor person, he gave up his subsidy. My dear brothers and sisters, when these 20 lakh LPG cylinders will reach the poor families whose kitchens are smoke choked, just think of the happiness of the mothers working in those kitchens! Just think of the relief and happiness of the little children who had been crying due to the smoke! Whenever our efforts are in the right direction, we get great results.
My brothers and sisters, if I talk about coal, some of the political pundits or experts will judge me on a political angle. This is not a place for politicking, so I would like to urge upon all the political pundits that in this case, the kind of  coal issue that I am going to raise, may please not be judged through the political angle. This is the requirement of our nation’s resolve. CAG said that when coal blocks were allocated through lottery, the nation lost Rs.1 lakh and 74 thousand crores. We also used this statistics in the election-speeches. Nevertheless, we sometimes thought that this much of loss may not have been there. But we went on saying like that. Later we decided that whether it be coal, or spectrum or any other mineral, all will be auctioned henceforth. Lo and behold ! the great strength of the Team India of 125 crore Indians and their resolve ! within a certain time limit the coal was auctioned and now almost Rs. 3 lakh crore would be accruing to the national exchequer.
Brothers and sisters, just ask yourselves whether corruption was rooted out or not? Whether the middlemen were ousted or not? Whether the door was shut on the face of the wealth-stealers of India or not? I did not make any speech in this regard. I just did it. The same thing happened in the case of spectrum. Right now FM radio auction is going on. A lot of pressure was put on me. People said 'Modi ji, FM is operated by the common men, there in no great profit in this business. Why are you putting even FM on auction? A lot of pressure was put on me. All attempts were made to dissuade me from this. But I said that the team India consisting of 125 crore of Indians wanted transparency.
Right now the auction is on for FM Radio in some 80-85 cities. The day before when I enquired, the auction amount had crossed Rs. one thousand crores. This money is going to be used for the poor people.
Brothers and sisters, what a run the country had at the hands of its leadership, how it was looted, what impact was put on the policies!  What kind of an activity it was that continued in the country?  Imported coal from the foreign countries was not given to the power plants near the coasts. It was transported to the factories of nearby areas of coal mines and the coal from those mines instead was taken to the factories in the coastal region. Now, even a small child in this country can understand as to how the goods can be utilized for the place where they are situated instead of going for their transport from that place to the other.
Brothers and sisters, we changed that decision. Nearby factories should be the first beneficiaries. And let me say that this small decision closed down the shops of the middlemen and the exchequer has got Rs. 1100 crores. My dear citizens, it will happen every year now.
Corruption in a way has become part of the system. Until it is stamped out from the system, dear brothers and sisters, I’ll keep suffering every atrocity, facing every obstacle but with your blessings I shall fulfill the dream of a corruption free India. I say this to you from the ramparts of the Red Fort with the tricolour as my witness and the understanding of the dreams of the 125 crore people. It’s been 15 months since you put our Government in Centre and gave me the mandate. This Government does not have any allegation of corruption against it for even a single penny. But I had said alongside that it was like the pests, the termite. Corruption free Government in Delhi only is not going to solve the whole problem. There are problems at the small places right now and the poor are getting troubled. We need to bring in a national level awareness for this. We need to comprehend this menace of corruption properly and get everyone on board to eradicate it. Then only can we get rid of the menace.
Brothers and sisters, let me say further that we have taken some very important steps one after the other to check black money, and that too in a very short span of time. 
The day we formed the Government, we constituted an SIT under the supervision of the Supreme Court. We did what was pending for three years. The SIT is doing its job. I attended the G-20 summit. These are the countries whose support we need for bringing black money back. On India’s insistence a resolution was passed against black money. All G-20 countries resolved to cooperate with each other and send back the black money to the country where it belonged. We adopted FATCA along with the United States. We have signed agreements with many countries for receiving real time information regarding Indian’s black money. We have taken several measures to check black money.
Brothers and sisters, we have passed a strict law for this. After this enactment every week people call us and complain that we have passed a very stringent law. They call it a draconian law and a black law and say that officers would harass them. Dear fellow citizens, we need injections if the disease is serious. Doctors also warn us about the side effects of such injections. Similarly, this disease is so serious that if we want a treatment, we will have to bear the side effects also. I know that people are upset with the law which we have passed. They find it troublesome. We have received many messages for diluting the provisions and relaxing it. Today I would like to tell Team India of 125 crore countrymen that even while bearing the side effects, we are moving forward against black money. This much has been done. It’s a fact that the process of bringing back the black money is long but now no one can dare to send the black money out of the country. This much has been achieved, whether someone believes it or not. Not only this, we have given some grace period for declaring undisclosed income and today I can say that people have come forward and declared their undisclosed income amounting to Rs. 6500 crores. This amount will accrue to our exchequer. It will benefit the poor of India. Friends, I assure you all that we will move forward with all the resolve to fulfill the commitments we have made.
Brothers and sisters, CBI had registered only eight hundred cases in the entire one year before formation of our government. We are still new in power but we have already registered eighteen hundred cases since we took charge; we have taken action against government employees. You can easily imagine and compare the figures. In the entire one year before we came to power, only eight hundred cases were registered and in the ten months of our government the corresponding number is eighteen hundred. It shows our ability to fight corruption.
In 2005, a law namely ‘PMLA’ was framed in our country. In ten years, an amount of ten thousand crore rupees has been recovered under that law. But you would be surprised to know that out of the total recovered amount of ten thousand crore rupees, four thousand five hundred crore rupees have been recovered in the last ten months. This is another example of our commitment to fight corruption about which we are not talking in press conferences on TV; rather we have taken steps on the ground and reaped success. We have endeavored to change systems. We have taken steps to ensure that the ‘MGNREGA’ wages go directly to the Jan Dhan account; that the scholarship for students goes directly into their bank accounts; and that there is least brokerage. And I believe that because of these steps the country can fulfill those objectives.
My farmer brothers and sisters, last year we had deficient rainfall. It was less than required. It affected the economy as well as our farmers. We were still able to curb the price rise. One will have to admit the fact that before us, the inflation was in double digits. Since we came to power, although there has been less rain and the farmers were distressed; we have been successful in bringing down the inflation from double digits to 3-4 percent. We will continue to strive to bring it further down because our dream is to provide wholesome meals to the poorest of the poor. However, we need drastic changes in the agriculture sector. The cultivable land is shrinking; it is getting divided between families and pieces of land are getting smaller. The fertility and productivity of our agricultural land must increase. The farmers need water and electricity and we are working towards their availability. We have decided to pump in fifty thousand crore rupees in ‘Pradhaan Mantri Krishi Sinchaai Yojna’. How will the water reach the farms? Water will have to be saved. We have to launch a movement in our agricultural sector with the mantra of “Save Water, Save Energy, and Save Fertilizers”. Hence, “Per drop more crop” is our watchword; each drop of water can contribute towards producing more crop and hence successful farming. We have moved in the direction of spending funds to take this cause further. 
In the recent past, when our crops got damaged due to hailstorm, we increased the compensation enormously. Such an increase has never been witnessed in the past 60 years. Not only this, earlier if there were any losses, there was the norm according to which one would be entitled for compensation only if the losses suffered were at least 50 per cent. We have brought it down to 30 per cent. Never in the past 60 years was such  a great initiative of helping the farmers taken. Farmers need urea. I would like to tell once again as to how to fight corruption. “Neem-Coating” is not the brain child of Modi, rather it is an idea propounded by Scientists and this idea has not only been brought before my government, it has come before previous governments as well. In our country, urea worth millions and billions of rupees is allocated in the names of farmers, but 15, 20 or 25 per cent of this urea is diverted to the chemical factories as raw material. Allocated in the names of farmers, this urea is pilfered through the middlemen. This pilferage of urea cannot be stopped unless we go for cent per cent “Neem-Coating” of urea. Therefore, irrespective of the burden caused to the exchequer, we have accomplished the task of doing hundred per cent “Neem-Coating” of urea.  As a result of this, now urea cannot be used for any purpose other than farming. Now, no chemical factory can indulge in any kind of pilferage of urea. The farmers will have as much urea as they need. Since the urea is “Neem Coated”, even if they use 10 per cent less of urea, their land will be benefitted with the nutritional value it requires. The farmers of my country will be having a new advantage of urea - I would suggest to all the farmers that even if by chance someone shows you urea without “Neem-Coating”, you take it to be unauthorized by the Government. If someone gives you a yellow powder, don’t even touch it.
Brothers and sisters, India cannot develop till the eastern part of the country develops. India cannot be said to be developing only on the basis of the development of the western parts of the country. India will move ahead only when our eastern Uttar Pradesh becomes prosperous, our Bihar becomes strong, our West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, North Eastern regions tread the path of development. These territories of India should become powerful. And so whether is a matter of infrastructure or of rail connectivity or of digital connectivity - in all these aspects, we have focussed on eastern India. This focus has resulted in the proposed laying of a gas pipe line in this region. Who could have thought that the states where there was no potable tap water even in kitchen, there we are working to supply the gas through pipe lines. Four urea fertilizer plants were shut down in eastern India. Youth of these states were unemployed and farmers were in distress. We have made new urea policy and we have also formulated new gas supply policy. This has resulted in revival of fertilizer plants of eastern centers of Gorakhpur, Barauni, Talcher and Sindari. Thus we are working to provide employment to the youth and fertilizers to the farmers.
Brothers and sisters, there is a Government Department for Army soldiers and for their welfare. In our country farmers are as important as soldiers. What have we done in sixty years! We have emphasized on the economic aspect of agriculture. With the intention to have flourishing agriculture and for agricultural advancement, the concerned ministry of this government has been named as 'Ministry of Agriculture'.
Brothers and sisters, Agricultural growth is as important as the welfare of farmers. Only talking about agricultural development is incomplete for rural life style and for agriculture based livelihood. That will become complete, when the welfare of the farmer is also linked.  Brothers and Sisters, the Ministry of the Government of India which was earlier known as ""Ministry of Agriculture"", from now will be known as the ""Ministry of farmer Welfare"" and in the days to come schemes for the welfare of farmers will also be formulated alike the schemes for agriculture  are prepared and the Government would make efforts to provide help to the farmers by means of setting permanent system for the problems that my farmers has to face in his personal life, the hurdles that he has to go through.
Brothers and sisters, in the coming days I wish to concentrate on an issue. There has been so many years of independence but even today there are about eighteen thousand, five hundred such villages in our country, where electric wires and polls are yet to reach. Eighteen thousand five hundred villages are deprived of the sun of independence, deprived of the light of independence, they are deprived of the rays of development of independence. If we will keep on following the old methods, perhaps it will take ten more years to electrify these eighteen thousand, five hundred villages with wires and polls. The country is not ready to wait for ten years. 
I took the meeting of government officials and enquired from them about the timeline. Someone promised to complete the task till 2019, someone assured to complete it till 2022. Some were hesitant due to dense forests or snowy hills, and some had apprehension due to inaccessibility of certain areas. But, it is now the solemn pledge of the ""Team India"" of 1.25 billion countrymen that the target of providing electric polls, electric wires and electricity to these 18,500 villages would be achieved within next 1000 days. I urge upon the states to come forward and accept this challenge. This is not pending in every state, only a few states will have to strive a little further. I would not like to count the name of such states, as it would be viewed politically and may attract political comments. Hence, it's better to avoid it. I, therefore, announce the pledge of the 'Team India' of our 1.25 billion countrymen, from the Red Fort, that electricity would be made available to 18,500 villages within the next 1000 days, with the help of states and local bodies. 
I have taken up another issue of concern, which is 'Welfare of Farmers'. Similar issue of grave concern is the under-development of such mining areas, from where we get mineral resources, such as coal, bauxite and other minerals. Now, look at the life of people there. They sweat to make our country rich but that region is not developed and, therefore, we have formulated a special scheme for the development of the labourers and farmers of the region from where minerals are extracted and around rupees six thousand crores will be spent every year on the regions which fall in the areas of my tribals brothers, located in my tribal areas. Where coal is found? Coal is found in tribal areas. We have undertaken work to see development takes place there.
Brother and sisters, our youth power is of import for taking the country forward in twenty first century and today, I want to declare that if we have to move ahead in comparison to the whole world, we have to encourage our youths, we have to provide them opportunities. How our youths become new entrepreneurs, how our youths become new producers, how a complete network of start-up by these new entrepreneurs is set up in the whole country? There should not be any district, any block in Hindustan where there are not start-up initiated in the coming days. Whether India cannot dream that India becomes number one in the world of start-up. Today we are not at that position. Brothers and Sisters, I have to provide strength to start-up and, therefore, I resolve that in the coming days ""Start-up India"" and ""Stand-up India"" will be there or the future of the country. And for a bright future of the country ""Stand-up India"" shall be launched when I want to move forward this job pertaining to ""Start-up India"", ""Stand-up India"", my brothers and sisters, in our country our bank officials have done a herculean task, and when you do a good job, my expectations rise a lot. 
My banker friends, my expectations are rising, so please do not get offended, but I trust you that your subordinate staff is contributing a lot for the economic advancement of this nation and in future they will continue to put in further more efforts. I want to assign you a task today. There are 1.25 lakh banking units i.e. 1.25 lakh branches of banks in the country. Today, I would like to assign a task to these 1.25 lakh branches. This year marks the 125th anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkarji. There are 1.25 lakhs branches of banks. This is my programme referred to as ""Start-up India"", under this programme more schemes will be formulated, but every branch must resolve and in the days to come resolve once again to disburse loans for start-ups to the tribals in the locality where there is any tribal habitation, and where there is no tribal habitation, the branch can provide loans to a dalit or a tribal, give financial support to them and thus enable 1.25 lakh Dalit entrepreneurs to come up. Let there be tribal entrepreneurs in the tribal settlements of this country.  We can do this, we can give a new dimension to star-up and secondly whether these one lakh twenty five thousand branches can formulate a special scheme for women entrepreneurs?  These one lakh twenty five thousand branches should promote start-up of women entrepreneurs and help them financially.  You will find that within no time, India would see a network of start up, new entrepreneurs would emerge and they would in-turn provide employment ranging from one to two to four persons which will transform India's economic life.
Brothers and sisters, when investment comes to the country, we expect more manufacturing work and more exports and the finance department of the Government offer new schemes to such investors.  It has its own significance and this should continue.  But today I have a new idea that the investment coming to our country in the manufacturing sector should be offered assistance based on new parameters and one of them shall be that an investor who comes with an enterprise which provides employment to maximum persons would be eligible for a different kind of economic package.
The Government would now formulate new schemes for new units linking it with employment and assistance of Government. We want to stress upon the growth of employment opportunities in the country. We have reached far beyond in the direction of fulfilling the dreams of Skill India and Digital India. Brothers and sisters, one area of corruption is job. The poorest of the poor man aspires for his son's job and we have seen that whenever a youth receives a call for an interview for a job, may be that is for interview in railway, for a teacher, for a peon, for a driver, he began to think about  who he should approach for recommendation?  Even his widow mother begin to brood over the issue. why? That is because in our country justice and injustice are mostly decided on the basis of interview rather than the basis of merit and it is said that the person has failed in the interview. I have not seen any such psychologist till now, who are capable of assessing a person on the basis of interviewing him just for two minutes.
Brothers and sisters, I have been thinking over it for many days that whether it is necessary to appear for an interview for a son of a poor mother, for a less educated person who is in need of petty jobs? Whether he can't get any job without an interview? Whether on the basis of his mark-sheet online-- it should be decided on the basis of online mark sheet that if we require five hundred people, than who should be those initial five hundred people, then who should be initial two thousand people. Of course, where the testing of physical fitness is required, the norms and system could vary there. Personality and experience of a candidate matters only for jobs of senior ranks, but it is painful to see that candidates even from the states of Nagaland and Mizoram rush to Mumbai to appear in exams for junior-level posts in Railways. I have to combat this problem. I impress upon the state governments and my colleagues of the Government to discontinue the stage of interview for junior-level posts as soon as possible. Such jobs should be given just on the basis of merit. This would help in curbing corruption, which hurts the poor people, and it would ease out their problem. It is my appeal to endeavour towards this goal. 
My countrymen enjoy sound sleep. But, if our 1.25 billion countrymen are able to enjoy their undisturbed sleep, it is only due to ever-readiness of our jawans to sacrifice themselves, who are posted at the borders. No country can under-evaluate the importance of its armed forces. For the 'Team India' of 1.25 billion countrymen, each and every soldier or jawan is the strength of the nation, wealth of the nation and force of the nation. Many successive governments have come and gone over the years. The issue of ""One Rank One Pension"" has come before every government, each one has considered its proposal, and each and every government has made promises on it, but the problem is still pending to be resolved. 
After my assuming office as Prime Minister I have not been able to do this by now. Today, I am again assuring all the service personnel and this is not being said by one man, I am saying this on behalf of One hundred and twenty five crores people of  ""Team India"". I am saying this under the Tricolour from the ramparts of the Red Fort. I say to service personnel, we have accepted ""One Rank One Pension"" in principle but talks are going on with its organizations. Talks have reached at the final stage and we want that all get justice keeping in view the development of whole country. We have to find the solution of this problem in the light of above context which is lingering on from 20-25 years. I believe that the trust in which talks are being held, some positive result will come out of it. And, therefore, I again assure that this Government has accepted ""One Rank One Pension"" in principle. How it is implemented in view of its nitty-gritty situation, we are taking the talks forward by engaging with its stakeholders. 
Brothers and sisters, India is completing 75 years of its independence in 2022. We have not to sit idle after celebrating 75 years of India's independence on 15th August, 2022. Today itself, on this 15th August, let we have a resolution for the 15th August, 2022 that 6 lakhs villages of India, each village must decide and resolve that by 2022, we will be able to overcome problem in every village. My 1.25 billion countrymen and we, in our lives, take a resolution for the 2022, the 75 years of Independence of India. Every citizen take a resolution that I will perform this task for the well being of the country and betterment of the society. Once my 1.25 billion fellow countrymen will move forward with a resolution, then by the dawn of 15th August 2022, when the souls of soldiers who laid down their lives for the freedom will see that the country might have fulfilled 1.25 billion  resolutions, 6 lakh villages might have realized their dreams. Cities, Metropolitan cities, every department of the government, every unit of the government should take a resolution and get to work. And there should not be any literature, there should not be any programme wherein 15th August 2022 is not re-iterated, where resolution for the 75th years of Independence is not re-iterated. A momentum need to be created. Brothers and Sisters the movement for freedom lasted several decades. Nevertheless the freedom was in the air only, then someone raised the issue of freedom in the year 1910, again in the year 1920 and again and again in the year 1930 and so on. The issue was re-iterated for decades, only then we attained freedom. In order to build a self confident, magnificent and prosperous India we have to make our country competent, prosperous and healthy. We have to fulfill the dream of a well cultured India, build self confident India and excellent India. No poor person in this country should remain without  shelter by 2022. We have to succeed in providing round the clock electricity. Our farmer should be capable, our worker should be satisfied, our women should be empowered, our youth should be self dependent, our elderly should be hail and hearty and our poor should be prosperous. No one should remain backward in our society and everyone should enjoy equal rights and entire Indian society should reel in harmony. With this dream once again I convey my heartiest congratulation to 1.25 billion countrymen on this pious festival of freedom with preparedness to move forward in a specific role for 75th anniversary of independence. Repeat me with full strength:- 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai,Bharat Mata Ki Jai,Bharat Mata Ki Jai.
Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram.
Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind!****AKT/AK

                Text of the english rendering of PM Shri Narendra Modi’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 70th Independence Day 

 My beloved countrymen, on this auspicious occasion of our festival of freedom; I extend lots of greetings to the one hundred and twenty five crores fellow nationals and also to entire Indian diaspora spread all over the world, from this rampart of the Red Fort. This festival of our freedom, this 70 years of our Independence, is the festival for our resolution to take the nation to new heights with a new resolve and a new fervour and new energy. We are able to breathe in a free air as the result of the sacrifices, renunciation and penance of our millions of great forefathers. We are also reminded of the youths who kissed the gallows. We also remember Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Pandit Nehru and countless great persons, who fought ceaselessly for the freedom of our nation. It is the result of their struggles that we are now fortunate enough to breathe as a free citizen. India is a very ancient nation. We have a history of thousands of years and our cultural heritage is also millennia old. Right from the Vedas to Vivekananda, from the Upanishads to the satellites, the Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan to  Charkhadhari Mohan, from the Bhim of Mahabharat to the Bhimrao; we have a long historical journey and  heritage. Our land has seen many historical ups and downs and our generations have waged many struggles and observed penance to bequeath great values to the humanity. India's age is not just seventy years. But having won freedom after a period of subjugation; we have made efforts to take the nation forward in this journey of seventy years. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel united the nation. Now, it is the responsibility of all of us to make this nation better. We all have to work ceaselessly for the realization of the dream of ' One India, great India'. (Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat). 
 Brothers and Sisters, We have not attained freedom for free of cost. Innumerable were the atrocities, but undeterred were our resolves also. Every Indian was a soldier in the battle for freedom. Each one of them dreamt of an independent India. May be every one of them was not fortunate enough to sacrifice, may be each of them was not fortunate enough to go to prison; but every Indian had a resolve and the leadership of Mahatma ji and also the inspiration of countless revolutionaries who had sacrificed every thing. All these movements contributed to our attainment of Independence. But, now we have to convert this freedom into 'the real freedom'. Now, this is the resolve of the one hundred and twenty five crores of Indians. So, just as we did not attain our freedom without sacrifices; we would not be able to attain ' the real freedom' without renunciation, without human endeavour (Purusharth), without bravery, without dedication and discipline. So, in order to take ahead this resolution of one hundred and twenty five crore Indians; all of us will have to move ahead with our specific responsibilities in a most committed manner. Be it a Panchayat or the Parliament, be it a village headman or the Prime minister; every one of us as well as every democratic institution will have to shoulder their responsibilities completely and perfectly. Only then we will be able to realize the dream of our the real freedom as soon as possible.This is correct to say that our nation is beset with many problems now- a- days. But, we should never forget that if we have the problems, then we also have all the capacities to solve them. So, if we move ahead with all our capabilities, we will find the ways and mean to solve all these problems. So, brothers and Sisters, if we have lakhs of problems, then we also have one hundred and twenty five crore brains also which are all capable to solve these problems.
 Dear Brothers & Sisters, there was a time when Government used to be surrounded by aspersions. But now time has changed. At present, no aspersions are being leveled on the Government. Rather, people have great expectations from it. When the Government is engulfed in expectations then it signifies hope and trust, which in turn generates those expectations. Expectations give pace towards good governance, invigorates and so the pledges are implemented ad continuum. My Brothers & Sisters, today when I am addressing you from the rampart of the Red Fort, it is, therefore, but natural that  we should  discuss the journey of good governance, the work done by the Government and work being done and should be done for the country.  I can present before you a very detailed account of work done and also multiple issues regarding the performance of the Government. During the tenure of two years, the Government has taken innumerable initiatives and multiple tasks have been done. If I start giving details about them, I am afraid I will have to talk about it for a week from this very rampart of the Red Fort. So instead of that temptation, I would like to draw your attention towards the work culture of the Government. Sometimes, it is easier to present the account of work done. But, it is not easy for a common man to comprehend, understand and identify the work culture without dwelling deep into the work culture. My Brothers & Sisters, My Countrymen, I would not talk solely about the policy, but also the intention and decisions of the Government.
 Dear Brothers & Sisters, it is just not an issue of direction and outline, rather it is about holistic approach and a resolve for transformation. It is confluence of trinity of expectation of people, democracy and support of people. It is both wisdom and consent. It is also pace and realisation of progress. Therefore, My Countrymen, when I talk about the Good Governance, it does implies bringing in transformation in the life of common man of my country. Good governance means that the government should be sensitive, responsive and dedicated to the common man. Then only good governance gets the emphasis. Responsibility and accountability should be at the root of it and it should draw its vital energy from there only for the government to be sensitive, dear Brothers and Sisters. We remember the days when there used to be a very long wait to go to any big hospital. People used to come to AIIMS, spend two three days and  then only it would be decided what diagnostic tests were to be done. Now we have been able to change this system. Registration is done online and the doctor’s appointment is also given online. The processes start on arrival of the patient at the appointed hour itself. Not only this but all his medical records are also available online. And we wish to develop it as a countywide culture in the field of medical treatment. Today this system has been put in place in 40 big hospitals of the country. Its basic premise is that the government has to be sensitive.
	Dear Brothers and Sisters, the government should be accountable. If it be not so then the problems of the common man are kept pending for solutions. How does the change come?  Now technology is there, but there was a time when the railway ticket in the railways, concerning the common man and the poor was available only two thousand tickets per minute. Those who might have seen it, would know how the buffering used to be there, nobody knew when the website would be operational again, but today I have to say with satisfaction that now it is possible to have fifteen thousand tickets per minute.The government should be accountable, it should take steps according to the necessities and expectations of the people. There is a class across the country, particularly the middle class, higher middle class whom you see troubled more at the hands of the income tax officials rather than the police at times. I have to change the situation and I am trying and I will certainly change it.
 There was a time when a common and honest citizen used to give two rupees extra as a measure of caution at the time of paying his income tax. He used to think that he might not be harassed, but once the money was deposited to the government exchequer, he had to run from pillar to post and seek recommendations for getting the refund. It took months together before the rightful money of the citizen was returned to him from the government exchequer. Today, we have made a system of issuing online refund. Today, refunds are given in one, two say or three weeks. Those who are hearing me today on TV, they would also be realising that they had not given any application, yet they had got refund directly into their account. So, this responsibility and accountability are the results of these efforts.
 It is equally important to lay emphasis on the transparency for good governance. You know that a global relationship has already started to become a common thing in the society today. A middle class man wants to have his passport- there was a time when about 40 lakh, 50lakh applications were received for getting passport. Today, approximately 2 crore people apply for the passport. Brothers and Sisters, earlier 4-6 months were taken for scrutiny of applications if one did not have recommendations. We changed that situation and today, I can say with pride that passports are issued to the citizens with all genuine details, in about one or two weeks and there is transparency no recommendation is required and  there is no dilly-dallying. Today, I can say, we have issued 1.75 crores passports (in 2015-16 itself.)

In Surajya there must be efficiency in governance and therefore, earlier, if a company had to set up a factory or desiring to do business in our country, applications were submitted. There was a task of registration only, one wanted to do something for the country, but almost 6 months passed in normal course. Brothers and Sisters, if efficiency is brought, then the same government, same rules, same officials have got geared up to perform the same task of company registration within 24 hours and they are virtually doing it. In the last July itself, they performed the task of more than 900 such registrations.
 Brothers and Sisters, good governance is also necessary for Surajya and the steps we have taken towards this good governance are that, as I had said last year from the Red Fort that we would exempt group 'C' and group 'D' posts from interviews, they might get job on the basis of merit. We have detected almost 9,000 posts for which thousands and lakhs of people need to be recruited. Now, there would not be any interview process for these 9,000 posts, my young men would not need to spend any money for interviews. Recommendations would not be needed, roads for corruption and agents will be shut and this work has been implemented.
 Brothers and Sisters, there was a time when a common man got satisfied if the government announced any plan or merely announced that this would be done, he used to think that something concrete would happen now. Then, a time came when people asked for the plan unless the drawing of the plan came. Then, there was a time when people asked for the budget. Today, the mood of the country has changed in 70 years. It does not get satisfied with the announcement, it is not satisfied by seeing the plan, if a budget provision is made, it is not ready to accept this. It is accepted when things get implemented on ground and we cannot bring things on ground with the old pace. We have to speed up our work, increase the pace further and then we can say that we have done something.
            Rural roads are a perpetual issue in our country. Each rural citizen craves for pakka roads.  Its a huge task. Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji took this task specifically. Even succeding governments  continued  this and the work continued. We have made efforts to fast track it. Earlier 70-75 Km of rural roads were completed in a day. Now we have increased that pace up to 100KM a day. This pace will fulfil the aspirations of common man in the days to come. 
	We have aid emphasis on energy, specifically renewable energy in our country. That was a time, when after so many years of independence, we started working on wind energy. Within a period of last one year we have increased it up to 40%. So this is the scale of up acceleration. Whole world is focussing on Solar energy. We have increased it approximately 116%-118%. This is not only a substantial incremental change, it’s a huge leap forward. We intend to enhance the things in quantum way.
	In our country, even before forming of our government, we had the power production. But to reach the power, you need transmission lines and the good transmission infrastructure. Two years preceding the formation of our government, 30-35 thousand kilometres of transmission lines were being laid annually. Today I wish to submit this with satisfaction that we have raised this to 50,000 Kilometres. So we have increased the pace here. If we take the commissioning of railway lines in previous 10 years, where commissioning means capacity to ply the trains and to finish all the trials, so earlier it was at the rate of 1500 kilometre in 10 years . But we have made it up to 3500 kilometre in last 2 years. We are to increase this pace even further.     
            Brothers and Sisters, Now we are connecting government schemes to AAadhaar Card, focussing on stopping the leakages through direct benefit transfer. Previous government had connected four crore  people to government schemes via Aadhaar Card. Today I can say this with satisfaction that in place of  that work of four crore, we have completed the task of connecting 70 crore people to government schemes via Aadhaar card. The remaining will also be taken into the fold.   
	Today, for middle class or for common people the ownership of a car is a matter of pride. There was a time when gas stove at home was deemed as a standard and as a symbol of social status. During the last 60 years of independence, 14 crore LPG gas connections were given. Brothers and Sisters, it is a great satisfaction to me that on one side, 14 crore gas connections were given in 60 years, while on the other side, we have given 4 crore gas connections in just 60 weeks. Please compare the two figures - 14 crore in 60 years and 4 crore in 60 weeks. This is the speed, by which a change has become possible in the quality of life of common men. We have also started the task of eradicating obsolete laws. The burden of unnecessary laws has been creating hindrance in the functioning of the government, the judiciary and the public. We have identified 1700 such laws, out of which 1175 laws have already been repealed by the Parliament and several other such laws are in the process of repealing.
 Brothers and Sisters, it had become a tendency among the people to say that certain work can be done and certain other work cannot be done, certain work cannot be done now and certain work cannot be done ever. A kind of negativity was prevalent in the minds of people. Now, a clear break through is visible in the mindset, a new synergy is seen in the functioning of the government. When an accomplishment is achieved, it stimulates dynamism, which sharpens our determination and then, the end result is not far away. 
 Brothers and Sisters, when we had launched ""Prime Minister Jan-Dhan Yojana"", it was almost an impossible task. There were banks and the governments, nationalisation had already taken place, but the common man of the country was not able to be a part of the mainstream of national economy.
 Brothers and Sisters, we have attained this impossible task through inclusion of 21 crore persons under ""Jan-Dhan Yojana"". This is not a matter of taking credit by the Government, it is really an achievement of 125 crore countrymen of the country, for which I salute them. The campaign for women pride in villages of the country is an important issue of today. The practice of open defecation should be stopped; toilets should be built in villages. When I had got the first opportunity to address from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I had expressed my feelings about it. Now, I can claim that more than 2 crore toilets have already been built in villages of the country within such a short period. More than 70 thousand villages are now free from the practice of open defecation. We are working towards bringing change in the lives of common man. 
 I had earlier announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort that we would electrify those 18 thousand villages, which are still without electricity.We are going to complete 70 years of independence, but they had not seen electricity. They were forced to live in the 18th century. We undertook this task of making possible the impossible and today I am glad to say that, though we have not been able to complete even half the task within a thousand days, we are still away from the half-mark, out of the 18 thousand, electricity has reached ten thousand villages. I have been told that there are many among those villages who are watching Independence Day celebrations for the first time today on television in their homes. Today, from here I extend special greetings to those villages.
 Brothers and Sisters, you will be surprised to know that at merely three hours journey from Delhi, there is a village called Nagla Fatela in Hathras region. It takes only three hours to reach this Nagla Fatela. But it took 70 years for electricity to reach there. 70 years, my brothers and Sisters! And therefore, I am introducing you to the work culture that we are following. 
 Brothers and Sisters, the LED bulbs were developed by the science and the researchers for welfare of every citizen. But in India it used to cost 350 Rupees. Who would buy it? And even the government would think, “It’s alright. The work is done. Someone must be using it.” But this should not be the attitude. If LED bulbs can bring about a change in the life of a common man, if it can ameliorate the environment, if it can improve India’s economy, then the government must make efforts in this direction. It is the nature of the government that it intervenes where it is not required and shies away from intervening where it is needed. We tried to change this situation, this work culture. And therefore, the bulb which used to be sold at 350 Rupees, it is now being sold at 50 Rupees because of governmental intervention. See the difference! 350 Rupees on one hand and 50 Rupees on the other. I do not want to ask where all this money used to go, however, thirteen crore bulbs have been distributed till date.
 The politics of our country has become populist; the economic policies have become populist. If three hundred Rupees subsidy for each bulb had been given from public exchequer, the Prime Minister would have been applauded for doling out five hundred crore to the people. But we have ensured that they save thousands of crores by providing bulbs at only fifty Rupees. We have already distributed thirteen crore bulbs and we have resolved to distribute 77 crores and I would like to appeal to my countrymen to use LED bulbs in their homes and save 200, 300, 500 Rupees in a year and save energy and save our environment. The day we achieve the target of 77 crore bulbs, we would be saving 20 thousand Mega Watt of electricity. When we save 20000 Megawatt electricity, it means we save around 125000 crores rupees.  Brothers and Sisters, you can save 125000 crore rupees of the country by using a LED bulb at your home.  We can fight against global warming by saving 20000 Megawatt electricity and contribute a lot towards the efforts aimed at the protection of environment and a common man can also contribute to it.  So, brothers and Sisters, we have worked in that direction-making the impossible possible.  
	You know that we depend on other countries of the world for energy and petroleum products and for that we have signed long term agreements with them so that we could get these products at fixed prices for a long period.  We have entered into an agreement with Qatar for buying gas till 2024 but the prices are so high that it is costly for our economy.  It was a result of our foreign policy relationship that we were able to renegotiate with Qatar, and the agreement which was the right of Qatar, and we were bound to buy gas from it till 2024, we negotiated with them and today, I can say with satisfaction that we made an impossible task possible, they renegotiated their prices and it will save 2000 crore rupees of the exchequer of India.  They were entitled to get these 20000 crore rupees but the nature of relationship that we have with them and our policies have made it possible.  The negotiations have been going on during the tenure of all the Governments and efforts were also made for Chabahar Port, which is an important link for connecting us with Central Asia, but today I feel satisfied to see an impossible task becoming possible.  When Iran, Afghanistan and India collectively march ahead in a planned way for the construction of Chabahar Port, an impossible task becomes possible.
	My brothers and Sisters, one thing, I want to talk about and which concerns the common man is inflation.  It is true that the inflation rate had crossed 10% mark during the tenure of previous government.  Due to our sustained efforts we were able to keep it below 6 percent.  Not only this, we have, recently, made an agreement with the Reserve Bank of India that the RBI should take steps to control the inflation at the level of 4 percent with allowance of plus minus 2.  We should leave behind the talks of balance between inflation and growth and work for moving ahead.  But the country witnessed drought during last two years and the effect of drought are readily seen on the prices of vegetables and the outcomes of sluggishness of market have resulted in some problems.  The decline in the production of pulses due to drought during last two years was also a cause of concern.  But, Brothers and Sisters, if the inflation would have increased at the same pace as it had previously increased, I don’t know how the poor of my country would have survived? We have tried our best to keep it under check, but still people have lot of expectations from this government and dear countrymen your expectations are  natural and I will not leave no stone unturned in achieving them. Whatever best I can do, I shall do that and keep the price of  poor man’s meal under check. 
 My dear Brothers and Sisters, country is going to celebrate the 350th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singhji. How can the country forget the saga of sacrifice which has been the tradition of Sikh Gurus? Today, when we are celebrating the 350th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singhji, I recall one best thought expressed by Guruji. Guru Gobind Singhji use to say, how can I consider those hands pure which have not done any service, hands which have not strengthened by labour and have not developed any blisters by toiling hard? Guru Gobind Singhji use to say this. Today, when we are celebrating the 350th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singhji I remember our farmers. Whose hands are more pure than theirs? Whose hearts are more pious than their? Whose intentions can be more pure than theirs? I thanks our farmers that despite two years of drought, they consistently endeavored to fill our granaries, I greet them for this. Drought situation has changed and this time we are witnessing good monsoon. Heavy rains have also created problems at some places. Government of India stood with those states and citizen who suffered due to heavy rains. Today, I specially want to thank our farmers, because, when we are facing shortage of pulses and our farmers have shifted to other crops, and rise in demand of pulses by common man, I have to say this with content that this time our farmers have increased the sowing by one and half times. I want to thank our farmers because they have come forward to solve the problem of the crisis of pulses and find its solution. We have decided the MSP for pulses and declared a bonus on it. We have streamlined the process of purchase of pulses and promoting the farmers for cultivation of pulses. This will benefit us in a big way. 
 Brothers and Sisters, when I was talking about work culture, one thing was clear that I do not look at the issues in isolation but as a whole. Let us see it as integrated and just take agriculture under integrated things, we have developed such work culture with lot of hard work, the complete chain of which can produce a great result. First of all we focussed upon- the wellness of this soil, wellness of this land, soil health card, macro-nutrition, concern for micro-nutrition and made the farmers understand that this is lacuna in your soil, these are the good qualities, your soil is good for this crop, this is not suitable for this crop and gradually the farmers started their planning according to this soil health card. The people, who have planned, tell me, sir our expenditure has been reduced up to 25 percent and 30 percent increase is being visible our production. This number is less at present, but in future as soon as this may pass on, this concept will gain momentum. The farmers have land and if they get water, then the farmer of my country has the power to produce gold out of the soil. The farmer of my country has this power and that is why we have emphasized upon water-management, emphasized upon water-irrigation, emphasized upon water-conservation. We are emphasizing upon how every drop of water may be utilised by the farmer, how to increase the importance of water, and get per drop more crop, micro irrigation. More than 90 percent irrigation projects were lying incomplete and stalled. We have taken up the responsibility to complete those projects first of all and will work in the direction that lakh of hectares of land may get the benefit of irrigation. We have taken a big leap towards solar pump so that the input cost of the farmers may be lessened because nowadays the farmers require electricity also, they require water, they need electricity, and electricity costs dearer. On account of it, the input cost of the farmer is going to be less, the recurring expenditure is going to be less and due to owning solar pump at home will result in owning electricity, owning the sun, owning the field, owing the barn and thus our farmer would be happy. We have succeeded in distributing 77 thousands solar pumps till now.
	 Brothers and Sisters, I would like to congratulate the scientists of our country. Good quality seeds are also required along with soil, water and solar pumps. The scientists of our country have developed more than 131 new farmable seeds compatible to the climate and nature of India, which have the capacity to enhance our per hectare production. The values they retain are also being increased. I heartly congratulate these scientists also. The farmers require urea as well as fertilisers. There was time when black marketing was in practice to get the fertilisers, there was time when the police had to lathi-charge for fertilisers. There was time when the farmer used to watch his crop being damaged in the absence of fertilisers before his very eyes. Brothers and Sisters, the lack of fertilisers has become a matter of past, it has become history now. Today, we have succeeded in utmost production of fertiliser by overcoming the shortage of the fertiliser.
 Brothers and Sisters, because of this production, the fertilizers are now available to the farmers in time as per their needs. Similarly, We conceptualized “Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana”. It’s   insurance cover includes maximum protection to farmer’s land and  his agro-produce at a comparatively much lower premium, and that too with a guaranteed cover. We have constructed new warehouses to preserve 15 lakhs tons of food grains.  Our country’s farmers will benefit only when we move towards value addition, and for this We have laid special emphasis on food processing for the first time. We have encouraged cent percent Foreign Direct Investment which would augment agro-based industries, and Consequentially, my brothers and Sisters, I believe it would help me and our farmers realize our dream of doubling latter’s income by 2022. These efforts would make it  possible and for realizing the same, We have taken steps one after another.
            Brothers and Sisters, Our country has a fancy for a trend. And the Governments, with an aim to leave an impression, have done a lot, and to fill the bill in this country, People go for some populist things and empty the exchequer. Governments have a trend of establishing an identity. Brothers and Sisters, I have tried my best to stay away from this allurement, and While doing so, I have tried to do several things in every range with the mantra of Total transformation, Transformation with transparency, Reform, Perform and Transform.
           Brothers and Sisters, We are far more committed to build the image  of Hindustan than that of our Government. Regardless of party’s identity, the Country’s identity holds primacy. For, If the Country moves on, it will yield dividends for the coming generations, for centuries, and exactly, for this reason, We have accorded primacy to the country’s identity and not to our party.  Now a days, You must have observed the scope of our work in Railways. While we are talking about having Bio-toilets in train, we also cherish the dream of Bullet train. While We talk about “Soil Health Card” for farmers, we also want to march ahead in the direction of satellite  and space technology. While talking about “Stand-Up India”, we are also taking steps towards “Start-Up India”. We are laying emphasis on Substance than on Symbolism. We are stressing on integrated development than on isolated development. Leaving aside entitlement, we are focused and emphatic on Empowerment because an empowering country, my brothers and Sisters, provides an identity to the Government through the prism  of the newly declared schemes. But sometimes the old schemes just tumble down. Nevertheless, the Govts. is a continuity. If the earlier Govts. have done some work; then it is in the national interest that the next Government rectifies their shortcomings and gives a go ahead to these schemes. The arrogance that this was the work of your Government and this is my Govt; hence we would not do this work; is not in the fitness of the things in a democracy. This is why, with all humility, we have given similar importance to the schemes of the previous governments. This is the hallmark of our work culture as our nation is a continuous and a ceaseless system and we wish to retain that system. This is why, I have a project called PRAGATI. Under this project, every month, I myself sit and review all the on going projects. You would be amazed to know that almost 119 projects worth Rs. seven and a half lakh crores started by various previous Govts. were lying pending. I got all of them going. I said, so much of money have been spent on them, so, all these projects should be completed. Now they are all on the way to completion. We created a project monitoring group. I asked them to look into all such projects and find out as to when were they started. I came to know that some of them were started 20 years ago, the other were started somewhere between twenty five to thirty to fifteen years earlier. The people living in the areas of these projects know all.  We identified such two hundred and seventy projects worth Rs. 10 Lakhs crores which were inaugurated by some earlier govts. and some crores of rupees were spent on all of them; but all that money was going down the drain. We started all such stuck up projects once again. Brothers and Sisters, such helding up and delaying of the schemes after having spent crores of rupees on them is a criminal negligence and we have tried to tide over such things. 
 Brothers and Sisters, earlier railway projects took at least two years in getting sanctions. A train is passing from somewhere, road have also been made on the both side; a rail over bridge is to be constructed. But the approval took two years. We have speeded up the approval process and have been able to shorten the approval time to three or four months, or maximum to six months.  
 Brothers and Sisters, however fast we may work, whatsoever may be the number of the schemes started by us; the touchstone of good administration of any Government lies in the last man delivery or the benefits accrued to that person. So, this has to be taken care off. Brothers and Sisters, when policies are clear, intentions are clear; then the sentiments behind the decisions are also a class apart and the decisions can be taken unhesitantly. So, due to the correct policies and the correct intentions our Government is taking unhesitant decisions and giving emphasis on the last man delivery.
 We have seen and if you also go through the newspapers of Uttar Pradesh, every year there were stories about the outstanding balance of Sugar Cane farmers. Every year, there was news that this is not being done by the sugar mill owners, that was not being done by the state Govt, that sugar cane farmers are in distress. Thousands of crores of the rupees was outstanding. So, we made schemes in this regard and tired to ensure the last man delivery and also ensured that the amount should reach to the farmers. Brothers and Sisters, out of the total old outstanding balance of the thousands of crores of rupees, I would like to inform you with a lot of satisfaction that almost 99.5% has been settled. It has happened for the first time after many years. I can point out in solace that all the sugarcane which was procured and which came for marketing this time for that almost 95 per cent of farmers have got the price of sugarcane produced and I am sure and I believe that the remaining 5 percent of farmers will also be paid in the coming days.
	Brothers & Sisters, We have initiated a mission to provide LPG Connections to the poor families. We have launched a dynamic mission under ""Ujawala"" scheme to get rid of smokes emanating from chulha for my poor mothers. A target has been laid down to provide gas connections to 5 crores poor families within 3 years. Efforts are in progress and we have already provided gas connections to around 50 lakhs and that also have been done merely within the last hundred days - you can imagine - that it may be possible to achieve the said target even before three years. We intend to emphasis upon Last Mile Delivery in this mission.
	Post has steadily become irrelevant due to onlining of our Post Offices, Information Technology, Whatsapp, messages, e-mail. Our country is known as the chains of Post Offices and we have revamped these post offices. Post Offices are linked with poor and marginalised people. Postman is the only representative of the Government who is linked with the feelings and affections of the common man. We have never safeguarded the interests of the Post Man who has always got the affections of everyone and the postman always cares for common people. We have taken measures to convert our post office into a Payment Bank. By setting of these Payment Banks, a network of Banks will be set up across the villages in the country. People will get the benefits of Jan-Dhan account. The funds of MGNREGA for the common man is now being transferred into their respective accounts through 'AADHAAR', the cases of corruption are decreasing. Everyone will be benefitted through the mission of converting the Post Office into a Payment Bank.
	Brothers & Sisters, PSUs in our country are merely set up for loss-making units or for turning into sick units slowly and steadily or for disinvestment. This has been the common practice in the past. We have strived to launch a new work-culture. Today, I can point out in satisfaction that we have succeeded to turn the operation of so called notorious Air India into an operational profit-making undertaking during the last year. It is a fact that which all the Telcom companies of the world are profit-making units, the BSNL was turning into a heavy loss-making undertaking. We have succeeded in bringing BSNL to operational profit for the first time. Nobody believed that the Shipping Corporation of India could also rake in profit, now it is bringing profit. There was a time when it was apprehended that how would a power factory last for a week. Whether we would be able to get coal for them or not. It also used to be reported that power factories have been shut down for want of coal. Now, we have sufficient stock of coal at the threshold of the power factories. It could be used for months by them. Dear Brothers & Sisters, we have achieved it.
	Often, you must have seen that there is huge talk of corruption in our country. I have observed it myself that how corruption has looked the poor people from the lowest strata of the society and how huge amount of money is being wasted.  We have linked AADHAAR Card and AADHAAR Number with the Government Policies.  Dear Brothers & Sisters, earlier there was a system under which funds used to be released from public exchequer for widow pension, scholarship, persons with disabilities and minorities and also we used to receive list of beneficiaries. We looked into it deeply and found that even unborn children are also listed in it and getting benefit out of such schemes. These middlemen used to siphon off billions of rupees from it and nobody even took notice of it. But under the AADHAAR System, we have removed all these middlemen from the list of beneficiaries and directly transferred the amount to the beneficiaries and found that these are millions of such ghost beneficiaries who do not exist at all and used to receive billions of rupees from it. Now that has been checked. We saved lot of amount. We decided to find out the needy persons who were excluded from that list so that the amount of money saved from it should invariably be deposited into the accounts of those persons who want to fight for their rights. We have worked in that direction to deliver it to the last man delivery and we have made it to reach it to them.
	All of us are aware of the Coal Scam. Today there is no accusation on the coal auction. No stigma is attached to it. The states which excavate coal in India, will continuously earn millions of rupees in the near future. There was a time when the auction of spectrum was surrounded by allegations. We auctioned it online and that has filled the coffers of the country, bringing about healthy competition and also fetching benefits for the nation. 
	Dear Brothers and Sisters, today the world is passing through an era of global economy. Every country today is inter-connected and inter-dependent. Economically, the whole world is somehow inter-connected in one way or other. However much we may progress in our country, we’ll have to keep the global economy, global arena in view; come up to the global standards, match it also to stay relevant, and contribute, and also lead the global economy when the time comes. Therefore, we’ll have to be alert all the time. We’ll have to comply with the global standards to make ourselves up to date. Recently, you must have seen how the World Bank, I.M.F., World Economic Forum, credit rating agencies and such other agencies in the world have all appreciated the progress of India. The world is constantly watching these things due to the decisions taken one after another by India in respect of legal reforms, improvement in system and changes in approach. We have very speedily improved our ranking in `ease of doing business’ ratings. In terms of foreign investment, with regard to foreign direct investment our country happens to be the most favourite destination in the world today. We have left behind even the big economies of the world in matters of growth rate and GDP.
	Dear brothers and Sisters, do you know what an U.N. institute has estimated about India for the next two years ?  They have estimated  that in two years India will come up to the third spot in the economic sphere in place of its present level at number ten.  Brothers and Sisters, logistic support, infrastructure, all these things are taken into account in global standards, comparisons are made with rich countries of the world. Brothers and Sisters, while making analysis regarding this logistic support and infrastructure of India, the World Economic Forum has said that India has reached above 19 ranks as compared to earlier positions and India is moving up and marching ahead rapidly. Brothers and Sisters, the way we are marching ahead with a dynamic and predictable economy in our country and also in global reference- the recently passed GST law, is also an empowering step towards it and all those parties deserve appreciations for this.
 Brothers and Sisters, I had talked about a campaign from the same place- ""Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao"". We do not do any work in piecemeal. We have an integrated approach and I still need the cooperation of the society in the initiatives which we have taken in ""Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao"". Every single parent need to be aware. We should honour the daughters, protect them and give them the benefit of government's schemes. We have covered millions of families under ""Sukanya Samridhi Yojna"" which guarantees benefits for the daughters when she grows up. We have given greatest importance to the insurance schemes in which women are benefitted. They are going to reap its benefits. We have ""Indradhanush Tikakaran Yojna""- because if we ensure two things for our mothers and sisters i.e. economic empowerment and empowerment against health problems and we educate them, you can take it as an assurance that if even a single woman is educated in the family, if she is strong physically and independent economically, she has power to pull the poorest of the poor family out of poverty and therefore we are working with emphasis on empowerment of women, health of women, economic prosperity of women, physical empowerment of women in our fight against poverty.
 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, ""Mudra Yojna""- I am happy that more than three and half crore families reaped the benefits of MudraYojna. In it, most of the people who reached to the door of banks were first timers. Even out of these almost 80 percent people were from SC/ST/OBC. Out of these too, 80 percent are women who took loans from banks, Mudra bank. This is to be considered that how will these womenfolk will contribute in economic development. Brothers and Sisters! last week we decided that our mothers and Sisters who have become the participants in the growth story, need leave after child birth. Earlier that leave was shorter but now we have increased this to 26 weeks, enabling the new mother to take care of her infant. Our weavers and the people working in textile, who make yarn and yarn rolls, used to get Rs.100.We have increased that to Rs.190 so as to strengthen the hands of my yarn producing mothers and Sisters.   Our mothers, Sisters and weavers who are engaged in silk production will now receive Rs.50 more per meter of production. This has also been decided that this Rs.50 per meter will not go either to the trader or to the middleman or to the dealer. Instead this Rs.50 per meter will go via Aadhaar directly to the account of the weaver who has produced it. This will empower the weavers. We have started schemes with this intention and effect is now visible.  
 My dear countrymen! When we visualize railway and post office then we are able to see the unity of India. More we increase the institutions connecting India, our setup will change and that will enforce the unity of the country. So in the same tune we have started a new market scheme for farmers with the name ‘E-NAM”. Today farmers can sell their produce online in any of the markets of the country. Now he is not constrained to compulsively sell his produce in the market which is 10 Kilometers from his field .Neither to sell at low prices which is not remunerative for his hard work. Now a uniform sort of market network is establishing throughout the country with ‘E-NAM’. GST is soon to result in uniform taxation system and a unitary arrangement thus achieved will unite India as well. You will be amazed to know that earlier a zone was to have surplus energy and there were no takers. Another zone used to be in dire need of electricity, had to remain in dark and factories used to be shut. To effect a change in this scenario, we earned a great success with the ‘One nation, One grid, One price’. Earlier it used to be Rs.10 per unit in summers but I went to Telangana few days back to find it to be one rupee ten paise per unit instead of that age old Rs. 10. This is the result of one-price system, which can connect the whole country.
 A worker of our county has to change his place of work after every one or two years. But, his amount, deducted under EPF, is not transferred. You will be surprised to know that when I took the charge of the Government, Rs. 27,000 crore were lying under EPF, which belonged to the workers. Workers were not able to claim their amount, as they were ignorant of the relevant process. To solve this problem, we have issued a universal account number to each worker, which would enable easy transfer of fund to his new place of work. Now, the worker would get his amount after retirement and it would no more be lying dormant in a government treasury. 
 We have strengthened various initiatives such as Bharat-Mala, Setu-Bharatam, and Bharat-Net etc. We are working towards connecting the whole country and towards economic development of the country through all these initiatives. 
 Brothers and Sisters, this year is important due to various reasons. The country is celebrating 1000th birth anniversary of Saint Sri Ramanuja Acharyaji. The country is celebrating 150th birth anniversary of Shrimad Rajchandra Ji, the Guru of Mahatma Gandhi. The country is celebrating 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.  The country is also celebrating centenary birth celebrations of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya ji. While remembering Sri Ramanuja Acharya ji today, I wish to underline his message to the country. He used to say that we should serve all the devotees of the Lord, irrespective of their caste and class. He had said that we should never humiliate anyone and should give respect to all, without any discrimination on the basis of age and caste. The issue that was given importance by Gandhi, Ambedkar, Ramanujacharya, Lord Buddha, our scriptures and by our all spiritual gurus too is the issue of 'our social unity'. 
 If the society disintegrates, the empire straggles, gets divided into the highs and the lows, the touchables and the untouchables, then brothers and Sisters, that society cannot sustain. There are social evils, centuries old social evils, but if the social evils have become chronic, they need a bit harsh and yet sensitive treatment. The lackadaisical attitude will not solve the social problems and this is the responsibility of 125 crore citizens. The government and the society together will have to steer through the social conflicts. Brothers and Sisters, all of us will have to fight against the social evils. We all will have to rise above social evils in our own behavior. Each and every citizen will have to rise above them and then only we can build a strong India. Without empowering our society, we cannot make India strong. Mere economic progress does not guarantee a strong India, the guarantee of a strong India lies in a strong society. And a strong society is built at the edifice of social justice. A strong society is built only on the edifice of social justice. Therefore, it is our duty to lay emphasis on social justice. Whether they be Dalits, the downtrodden, the exploited, the deprived, my Adivasi brothers, the rural population, the urban population, the literate or the illiterate, the small or the big- the 125 crore of our fellow countrymen constitute our family. We together have to take forward our country and we all have to work in the same direction.
 Brothers and Sisters, today the entire world acknowledges the fact that India is a country of youths. What cannot be achieved by a country through its youth power whose 65 percent population, about 800 Million people, is below the age of 35 years? Therefore, my brothers and Sisters, it is the need of the hour that the youth get opportunity and employment. Today we are heading towards the birth centenary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya. Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya spoke of welfare of the last human being which was even the view of Mahatma Gandhi. Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya believed in the philosophy of ‘Antyodaya’. Welfare of the poorest and the weakest was the central theme of the political philosophy of Pt. Deendayal Upadhyayji. He used to say that every youth should get education, every youth should be skilled and every youth should get the opportunity to realise his dreams. We have taken many initiatives to realise those dreams of Pt. Deendayalji and to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of 800 million youths of the country. The way the road network in the country is expanding, the largest number of vehicles are being manufactured in the country, the country is becoming the largest exporter of softwares, more than 50 new mobile factories have been set up in the country, all these things have created opportunities for the youths. If two crore door toilets have been constructed, it has provided employment to someone, cement has been procured from somewhere, iron has been purchased from some other person, and the wooden work has been got done from somewhere else. As the scope of work expands, the possibilities of employment generation also increase. Today, we have stressed in that direction.
 Similarly, we are working on 'skill development' as a mission so that crores of youth could acquire skills. We have changed a law, though it seems very small, and this law is 'Model Shop and Establishment Act'. We have sent an advisory to states to give reasons why the big malls are allowed to open 365 days and upto 12 in the night but a small shopkeeper in the village has to shut his shop after sunset. Even a poor should get the opportunity to keep his shop open for 365 days. Why should our Sisters not get the opportunity to work in night? We have made legal provisions so that our Sisters could go to work in night also. There should be arrangements for their safety and other requirements but they must get the opportunity to work. These are the things which increase employment. Brothers and Sisters, we are working in that direction and we are ready to do it.
 Brothers and Sisters, this is the government, we are the persons who don't believe in delaying the things, we know how to fight not how to delay, so unless we deal with the problems head-on, it is not going to happen. Today when we are celebrating our freedom in the country, someone among the army jawans, who live and die for the country, would be ready for taking the bullets on the border, someone will be sitting in bunker and some other one would not be fortunate enough to meet his sister on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan. How many jawans are working in armed forces? More than 33000 police personnel have got martyrdom since we got our independence. Why should we forget them and how can we? These are the people due to whom we can live a life of peace and happiness. The issue of “One Rank One Pension” was pending for many years. We do not keep the issues pending but we face them. We have fulfilled our promise of “One Rank One Pension” and have spread happiness in the home of every Indian soldier. We did this work. 
 It was the feeling of our countrymen that the files pertaining to Netaji Subhash Babu should be declassified. Today, I bow my head and say that without caring for the result we have decided to declassify these files; a task which was impossible and kept pending since long. We invited Netaji’s family members and shown them the files and this process of declassifying will continue. I requested the other countries of the world to declassify the files held by them and hand them over to India because Indians have full right to know about Subhash Babu and history of India. We have worked in that direction. 
 Bangladesh -- When partition of India took place, a boundary dispute existed since then. A boundary dispute prevailed since the formation of Bangladesh. Many decades passed. Brothers and Sisters, all parties have together solved the Indo-Bangladesh border dispute and we have amended the constitution also. 
 Brothers and Sisters, a middle class person wants to construct his own house, wants to buy a flat. Builders lobby shows him a beautifully printed booklet and the helpless soul falls prey to it. He is not having any technical knowledge, he pays the installments but he is not getting the promised house in time. A middle class makes one house in his whole life and in it he invests all his capital. Brothers and Sisters, we have put a check by passing the “Real Estate Bill”, so that a middle class should not face any problem if he wishes to own a house. We have worked for this. 
 Brothers and Sisters, I have already said that this year is the 150th anniversary of Shrimad Rajchandra Ji, the guru of Mahatma Gandhi. When Gandhiji was staying at South Africa, then also he was having correspondence with Shrimad Rajchandra Ji. In one of his letter Shrimad Rajchandra Ji discussed violence and non-violence. In that letter Rajchandra Ji writes, when violence came in to existence from same time the principle of non-violence also born.  The important thing in both is that which we prefer or which is being used in the interest of mankind.
 Brothers and Sisters, the discussion of violence and non-violence is very inherent in our country. Humanity is in our blood. We are the people of a great, colossal culture. This country is full of diversity, colours and beauty. This is such a bouquet of mother India wherein all type of fragrances, all type of colours and all type of dreams exist. Brothers and Sisters, the unity of diversity is our biggest strength. The mantra of unity is connected to our roots. 
 Brothers and Sisters, a country having more than hundred languages, hundreds of dialects, innumerable attires, innumerable life styles, despite that this country remained united- its main reason is our cultural heritage.  We know how to respect, we know hospitality, we know how to assimilate, we have carried this great tradition and that is why there is no room for violence and atrocity in our country. If the democracy of India is to be strengthened, the dreams of India are to be fulfilled then the path of violence would never bring success for us. Nowadays a game of killing the innocents is being played on the pretext of Maoism in forests, on the pretext of extremism at border, on the pretext of terrorism at hilly areas by carrying guns on shoulders. Forty years have passed, this mother soil has grown blood stained but the persons on the path of terrorism have not achieved anything. I would like to remind those youth that this country will never tolerate violence nor would it ever put up with terrorism.  Nor would it bow down to terrorism. It will never succumb to Maoism.  But I exhort them and say that you still have time-return to the mainstream.  Just think about your parents' dream; just reflect on the hopes and expectations of your parents; return back to the mainstream; live a happy and peaceful life, for, the path of violence never fetches benefit to anybody.  
 Brothers and sister, we talk about foreign policy.  I don't want to go into details.  We had invited the leaders of SAARC Countries on the day we took oath at the Centre.  Our message was clear that we all, neighbouring countries, have a common problem, and that common challenge is poverty.  Let us fight this poverty together, by fighting one-another, we are left shattered but if we fight this poverty, we will walk towards prosperity.  So, I exhort all neighbouring countries to join us in this fight against poverty.  No freedom can be much bigger than the freedom of our citizens from poverty; freedom of our country's citizen from poverty.  No liberation is more liberating than the freedom from poverty.  Whenever a citizen from the neighbouring countries would get freedom from poverty, we will feel elated regardless of the fact whether the poor belongs to us or our neighbouring country.
  Brothers and Sisters, what kind of people are those who got drive from humanity and, what is the kind of those who reward terrorism?  I want to place two pictures before this world, and I say to the world, I say to those who believe in humanity that just weigh out the attack, when terrorists brutally killed innocent children in a school at Peshawar.  The attack take place in Peshawar, and was a terrorist incident.  The innocent children became victim of the bloodbath; the temple of learning had blood stream all around; innocent children were slaughtered.  Hindustan, the Parliament had tears in it's eyes; Every Indian school was in tears; every child of India felt the trauma of the deaths of children in Peshawar.  His tears had become unstoppable.  Every child, who was killed in Peshawar in the terrorist attack, ached our heart too.  This is the drive of our nurtured culture of humanity; this is our humanity, but if you look around, you will find a more to glorify terrorists.
 Where innocent people are killed in terrorist attack, and they celebrate, what type of terrorism inspired life it is, what type of these creations of the terrorism inspired governments are? The world will understand these two differences properly, this is sufficient for me. Today I want to specially honour and thank to some people from the ramparts of Red Fort. For the past few days the people of Baluchistan, the people of Gilgit, the people of Pakistan occupied Kashmir, the way their citizens have heartily thanked me, the way they have acknowledged me, the goodwill they have shown towards me, the people settled far across, the land which I have not seen, the people I have not met ever, but people settled at far across acknowledge the Prime Minister of India, they honour him, so it is an honour of my 125 crores countrymen, it is respect of my 125 crores countrymen and that is why owing to the feeling of this honour, I  want to heartily thank the people of Baluchistan, the people of Gilgit, the people of Pakistan occupied Kashmir for having an expression of thankfulness.
 Brothers and Sisters, today when we are celebrating the seventy years of Independence, then there is a big contribution of freedom soldiers for the country. When there is a contribution of these freedom soldiers, then the Government is deciding to increase 20 percent in the honouring amount being received, pension being received by the all these honourable freedom soldiers family members. The freedom fighters who earlier used to get 25000 rupees, will now get 30000 rupees. It is my small effort to pay my respects to the sacrifice and oblation of our freedom fighters.
 Brothers and Sisters, when we talk about the history of freedom struggle of our country, some persons are talked about a lot, some are excessively mentioned but the contribution made by the people living in jungles, the tribals, in the freedom struggle was unmatched. They used to live in jungles. We hear the name of Birsa Munda but perhaps there would be no tribal dominated district where the tribals would not have fought and given sacrifice since 1857 to the time we got freedom. They proved through their sacrifice what is freedom, what is struggle against servitude. But our forthcoming generations are not much aware of this history. The government desires and plans that in the coming days, in the states where these freedom fighters, who were tribals, who lived in jungles, fought against Britishers, who were not ready to succumb. The Government would work towards building permanent museums in various states dedicated to tribal brave freedom fighters, wherever land would be available for the purpose, where their contributions and memoirs would be displayed, so that coming generations could be able to know about their sacrifices for the country. 
 Brothers and Sisters, in the midst of the debate on inflation, we are realising one fact that the entire economy of a poor household is affected if somebody falls ill. The wedding of their daughters gets stalled, the education of children gets stalled and sometimes even food is not available in the evening. Healthcare is getting costlier and that is why, I am announcing an important scheme from the ramparts of the Red Fort for the healthcare of BPL families. Under this scheme, in the coming days, if such poor families have to take medical facilities, the government will bear expenditure upto Rs.1 lakh per year, so that my poor brothers are not deprived of healthcare facilities and their dreams are not shattered. 
 My dear Brothers and Sisters, let us proceed forward with a new determination, new energy, new enthusiasm by getting inspiration from those great persons who scarified their lives for our freedom.  We did not get an opportunity to die for the country but we have the opportunity to live for the country. We should dedicate our life to the nation. We should achieve something of substance for the nation. We should fulfill our responsibilities and also inspire others to accomplish their responsibilities. We should stride forward for building of one society, one dream, one resolution, one direction and one destination. With this very pious feeling, I once again bow my head before the great personalities of the country, the soldiers who risk their lives for our security on water, land and air fields and also those 33 thousands martyrs who sacrificed their lives for us. So, I, hereby, dedicate myself to dream about the future of the country and call on all of you from the rampart of the Red Fort to speak with your full might : Bharat Mata Ki Jay! Let the voice reach to every corner of the world.
 Bharat Mata Ki Jay! Bharat Mata Ki Jay! Bharat Mata Ki Jay!
 Vandematram!  Vandematram! Vandematram !
 Jay Hind! Jay Hind! Jay Hind!
 Thank you.  ***  KSD/AKT/NT/SH

                 English rendering of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s Address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 71st Independence Day- August, 15, 2017 







My dear fellow citizens,    
Greetings from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the auspicious occasion of Independence Day. 
Nation is celebrating the Independence Day with the festival of Janamashtmi today . I can see a number of Bal Kanahiyas here. We are fortunate to have in our cultural and historical heritage from a Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan to Charkhadhari Mohan. 
From the ramparts of Red Fort, on behalf of our 125 crore countrymen, I bow and pay respects to all those men and women who have sacrificed their lives, who have undergone immense sufferings and made sacrifices for the independence, glory and pride of the country. 
Sometimes, natural calamities are a big challenge for us. A good monsoon contributes immensely to the prosperity of the country. However, due to climate change, sometimes it turns into a natural calamity.  Several parts of the country faced natural calamities recently. Besides our innocent children lost their lives in a hospital. Our 125 crore countrymen stand shoulder to shoulder with them in this hour of crisis and grief. I assure the countrymen that in this hour of crisis we shall leave no stone unturned to ensure the wellbeing of all. 
My dear countrymen, this year is a special year for independent India. We commemorated 75 years of Quit India Movement last week. This year we are also commemorating the centenary of Champaran Satyagrah and the Sabarmati Ashram. The centenary of Lokmanya Tilak’s call   “Swaraj is my birth right” falls this year as well. The year marks the 125th Anniversary of the Ganesh Utsav which led to the rise of community awakening through the celebrations. It inspires us to dedicate ourselves to a cause for the country.  A collective resolve of the citizens was visible during 1942 to 1947 across the country which forced the British to Quit India within a span of five years. We will have to exhibit the same resolve from now  on in the 70th year of independence to 2022, the 75th year of independence. 
We now have five years before we reach the 75th year of our independence. Our united resolve, strength and determination to work hard remembering the memory of our great patriots will help us to build an India of their dreams by 2022. Therefore, we have to take the country forward with a pledge to build a New India. 
We are aware of the power of the collective resolve, hard work, sacrifice and devotion of our 125 crore citizens. Lord Krishna was immensely powerful, but it is only when the milkmen came out with sticks in his support that they could lift the Govardhan parvat. When Lord Rama had to go to Lanka, the monkeys of vanar sena came to his help, Ramsetu was built and Lord Rama could reach Lanka. Then there was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who empowered his countrymen to weave the fabric of independence with cotton and spinning wheel.  
The collective resolve and strength of the people got freedom for our country. No one is small or big. We have in our memory the story of squirrel which became an agent of change. That’s why we must remember that no one among the 125 crore people is either small or big – everyone is equal.  
If each one of us, irrespective of where he belongs to, strives with a new resolve, a new energy, a new strength, we can change the face of the country with our combined strength in the 75th year of our independence in 2022. It will be the New India – a secure, prosperous and strong nation. A New India where there is equal opportunity for all; where modern science and technology play an important role in bringing glory for the nation in the global arena.  
Our freedom movement is linked to our sentiments. We know it well that at the time of the freedom movement, the teacher who was engaged in teaching, the farmer who was tilling his land, the laborer who was working – all of them knew in their hearts that whatever they were doing, was contributing towards the independence of the country. This idea is a great source of strength. In the family, food is prepared everyday but it becomes ‘prasad’ only when it is offered to the deity. 
We are working, but if we do so in the spirit of working for the glory of mother India, for the divinity of mother India, if we do it to rid our countrymen of poverty, if we do it to properly weave our social fabric, if we discharge our duties with feelings towards the country, if we do it with a sense of devotion to country, if we do our work by dedicating it to the country, then the achievements will be much more. That is why we should move forward with this spirit.  
January 1, 2018 will not be an ordinary day – those born in this century will start turning 18. For these people, this is a decisive year of their lives. They are going to be the creator of the destiny (Bhagya Vidhata) of our nation in the 21st century. I heartily welcome all these youth, honour them and offer my respects to them. You have an opportunity to shape the destiny of our country. A proud nation invites you to become a part of its developmental journey. 
My dear countrymen,  
When Arjuna was posing a lot of queries to Lord Krishna in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, then Krishna told Arjuna that you achieve goals as per your thinking and beliefs. We have a strong determination, we are committed for a brighter India. We, who have grown up with a state of hopelessness, have to reject the feeling of despair and must now march ahead with confidence. 
We have to leave this 'Chalta Hai' attitude. We have to think of 'Badal Sakta Hai'- this attitude will help us as a nation. We should have this confidence that with sacrifice and hard work and a resolve to do something, we will get necessary resources and the ability to do it and then a big transformation will happen, and our resolve will convert into accomplishment.  
Brothers and sisters,           
It is natural for our countrymen to think of our safety and security. Our country, our military, our brave-hearts, our uniformed forces, be it any force, not just the army, air force or navy, all the uniformed forces, whenever they were called upon to do so, they showed their valour, their strength; our brave-hearts never turned their back in making the supreme sacrifice. Be it Left-Wing-Extremism, be it terrorism, be it infiltrators, be it the elements fomenting trouble inside our country- the uniformed forces of our country have made extreme sacrifices. And when the surgical strike was carried out, then the world had to acknowledge India’s capability and strength.  
My dear countrymen,  
India's security is our priority. Be it our coast line or our borders, the space or the cyberspace, India is capable of ensuring its own security and strong enough to ward off any threats against the country.
My beloved countrymen, 
Those who have looted the nation and looted the poor are not able to sleep peacefully today. Due to this, the confidence of the hardworking and honest person is increasing. An honest man now feels that his honesty matters. Today, we are celebrating a festival of honesty and there is no place for dishonesty. This gives us new hope. 
The law against Benami property was lying in limbo for years. Now, we have come up with a law against Benami Property. In such a short time, the government has unearthed Benami properties worth over Rs.800 crores. When these things happen, the common man develops faith that the country is for the honest persons. 
The 'One Rank - One Pension' policy for our defence forces was stuck up for 30-40 years. Our government implemented it. When we fulfill the aspirations of our soldiers, then their morale goes high and their resolve to protect the nation grows manifold. 
The country has many states and a Central Government. GST has shown the spirit of cooperative federalism and has given competitive cooperative federalism a new strength. The success of GST can be attributed to the hard work that has been put in to make it a success. Technology has made it look like a miracle. The global community is surprised how we were able to roll out GST in such a short time. It is a reflection of our capability and helps in building the confidence and faith of the future generations. 
New systems are emerging. Today roads are being built at twice the speed. The railway tracks are being laid at double the speed. More than 14 thousand villages that were hitherto shrouded in darkness even after Independence, have been provided with electricity. Bank accounts of 29 crore people have been opened, more than 9 crore farmers have got Soil Health Card. More than 2 crore poor mothers and sisters are no longer using the fuel wood and using LPG gas stove NOW. The poor tribals have gained faith in the system. The person at the last mile of development now joins the mainstream and the nation is marching ahead. 
 More than 8 crore loans have been sanctioned without guarantee to the youth for self-employment. The interest on bank loans have been lowered. Inflation is under control. If a person belonging to the middle-class wants to build his house, then he gets a loan at a lower rate of interest. In this way, the country is moving forward and people are joining the movement.
The times have changed. The government is determined to do all it says, like doing away with the interview process. 
In the labour sector alone, even a small businessman had to fill up to 50-60 forms, but we have now made it more convenient by reducing it to just 5-6 forms. I can provide many such instances of Good Governance, simplifying the process of Governance. By reiterating this we have enforced faster decision making. And that is why 125 crore countrymen have been able to repose faith in our governance.   
Dear Countrymen, 
India today has gained in stature across the globe. You will be happy to know that we are not alone in our fight against terrorism. Many nations are proactively supporting us. 
Be it Hawala, or any inputs related to terrorism, the global community is supporting us with critical information. We have joined hands with other nations in the combined fight against terrorism. I extend my heartfelt greetings to all those countries who are standing in solidarity with us and acknowledge our prowess.  
For the development and progress of Jammu & Kashmir, its prosperity, and fulfilment of the aspirations of the citizens, not only the J&K government, but we as responsible citizens also have a responsibility. We are committed to restore the state to its former glory so as to experience the paradise that it was, once again. 
On Kashmir there is rhetoric and politics. But I am clear in my belief on how to win the war against separatism, which is spread by a handful of people. The problem will be solved neither by abuse or bullets - it will be solved by embracing all Kashmiris. Such is the legacy of 125 crore Indians. Hence, neither by abuse nor by bullets, change will come by embracing all. And we are moving forward with this resolve.   
We shall take strict steps against terrorism. There is no question of being soft on terrorism or terrorists. We have been asking the extremists to join the mainstream. Democracy provides an equal opportunity and rights to be heard for all. The process of engagement can take place only by their joining the mainstream.  
I deeply appreciate the efforts of security forces in curbing the Left Wing extremism which mobilized a lot of youth from these regions to surrender and joined the mainstream.
Security forces are keeping a tight vigil on our borders. I am delighted to announce that today the Indian Government is launching a website which will give an account of the valour of the Gallantry Award winners.  A portal is also being launched which aims to provide the entire details of these brave hearts who have brought pride to the nation. The story of sacrifices made will certainly inspire the younger generations. 
With the help of technology, we are trying to promote honesty and transparency in the country.  Our fight against black money will continue; our fight against corruption will continue. With the intervention of technology, slowly we are trying to link Aadhaar with the system.  We have been successful in infusing transparency in the system. People from around the world have appreciated this model and have been studying it. 
A common man living thousands of kilometres away can now supply his products to the Government. He doesn’t need any middle man. We have launched a portal called “GEM”. The Government is making procurement through this portal. We have been successful in bringing transparency at various levels.  
Brothers and Sisters, 
Implementation of Government schemes are gaining momentum. When a work is delayed, it is not only the project that is delayed. It is not a matter of expenditure of money. When a work is stalled, the poor families are the ones who suffer the most.  
We can reach the planet Mars within 9 months; we are capable of achieving that.  
I review Government Projects every month. A specific project came to my notice. It was a 42-year old project. 70-72 kilometres of Railway lines were to be laid, but the project was lying in limbo for the last 42 years.   
My brothers and sisters,  
When a country that is capable of reaching Mars within 9 months, how is it possible that it is not able to lay 70-72 Kilometres railway lines for 42 long years. It sets in doubts in the minds of the poor. We have taken care of all these things. We have been striving to bring in the changes through technology. Whether it is Geo-Technology or Space-Technology, we have tried to link all these technologies to bring in transformation. 
You must have seen that there was a time when tension prevailed between the Centre and the States for Urea and Kerosene. The Centre was like an elder brother while the State was treated like a younger brother. I have been a Chief Minister for a long time and I know the importance of states in the development of the country. I know the importance of the Chief Ministers and the State Governments. Hence , we laid emphasis on Co-operative Federalism. Now we are moving towards a Competitive Co-operative Federalism. You must have seen that we are taking all the decisions together.  
You may recall that one of our Prime Ministers in his address from the ramparts of Red Fort had talked about the poor state of affairs of the power supply companies of the country. He expressed his concerns over the issue. Today with the “UDAY” Yojana, we have worked together to resolve the issues with these power companies. It is a concrete example of federalism in its real sense. 
Whether it is GST or Smart City Project, whether it is Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, or construction of toilets, or ease of doing business, all these are being accomplished by working together shoulder to shoulder with the States.  
My dear fellow countrymen,  
In the New India, the biggest strength is democracy. But we have reduced our democracy to mere ballot boxes. However, democracy cannot be confined only to ballot boxes.  Hence our resolve is to see to it that we have a democracy in New India, where people are not driven by the system, rather the system is driven by the people. Such a democracy should become the identity of New India and we want to move towards that direction.  
Lokmanya Tilak Ji had said “Swaraj is my birthright”.  In Independent India our Mantra should be “Good Governance is my birthright”. ‘Suraja’ or Good Governance should be our collective responsibility.  The citizens should fulfil their duties and the Government too should discharge its responsibilities.  
When we move from “Swaraj” to “Suraja”, the citizens do not lag behind. For example, when I called upon the countrymen to give up gas subsidy, the nation responded as a whole. I have spoken about cleanliness. Now people are joining hands from every part of the country to take up this cleanliness drive forward.  
When demonetization was announced, the world was surprised. People thought that this was the end of Modi. But the way our 125 crore countrymen had shown patience and faith, we were able to take one after another step in our drive against corruption. 
With this new practice of people’s participation, our effort to take the country forward with people’s involvement will help us to reach our goal. 
My dear fellow countrymen,  
Lal Bahadur Shastri had given the slogan “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.”  Our farmers have not looked back since then. They are now producing record harvests and scaling new heights despite facing natural adversities. There has been a record production of pulses this year.  
My dear brothers and sisters,  
India never had the tradition to import pulses and if it had to import on rare occasions, it was only a few thousand tons. This year when they produced 16 lakh tons of pulses to provide nutrition to the poor, the government took the historic step of encouraging them by buying their produce. 
Pradhan Mantri  Fasal Bima Yojna has provided a security cover to our farmers. Three years back, this scheme which was running under a different name earlier, covered only 3.25 crore farmers. Now over a short span of three years more farmers have been brought under its ambit. The number is soon going to touch the 5.75 crore mark. 
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojna aims to meet the demand of water of the farmers. If my farmers get water, they can produce rich harvests from their fields. That is why I had made some announcements from the ramparts of Red Fort on the last Independence Day. Out of those, we have completed 21 projects and remaining 50 would be completed soon. I have resolved to complete 99 big projects. By completing those 99 big projects before 2019, we shall fulfill our commitment. We cannot change the lot of our farmers until we hand hold him from procuring seeds to ensure that his produce reaches the market. For this we need infrastructure and supply chain. Every year vegetables, fruits and grains worth lakhs of crores of rupees are wasted. In order to change the situation, the government has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment in food processing sector. Government of India has launched ‘Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojna’ to encourage infrastructure building. Due to this, systems shall be put in place that will ensure hand-holding of the farmers from supplying seeds to marketing his produce. Such arrangements will usher in a new change in the lives of crores of our farmers. 
With the changes in demand and technology, the nature of jobs in our country has been changing. The Government has launched several new initiatives in the employment related schemes and also in the manner in which the training is imparted for the development of human resource according to the needs of the 21st century. We have launched a massive program to provide collateral free loans to the youth. Our youth should become independent, he should get the employment, he should become the provider of employment. Over the past three years, ‘Pradhanmantri Mudra Yojana’ has led to millions and millions of youth becoming self-dependent. It’s not just that, one youth is providing employment to one, two or three more people.  
In the education sector, we have taken an important step to grant the universities freedom from restrictions to make them the world class universities. We have asked 20 universities to decide their own destiny. The government will not interfere in their functioning. Besides, the government is willing to provide funds up to Rs. 1,000 crores.  We have appealed to them and I am confident that the education institutions of our country will certainly come forward and make it a success.  
Over the last three years, we have set up 6 IITs, 7 new IIMs and 8 new IIITs and we have also done the groundwork for linking the education with job opportunities.  
My mothers and sisters, the women in the families seek employment in large numbers.  And therefore we have taken a very important step to reform the labour laws to provide them the employment opportunities in the night also.  
Our mothers and sisters are an integral unit of our families. Their contribution in making our future is extremely important. And that is why we have decided to increase the paid maternity leave to 26 weeks from the earlier 12 weeks. 
In the context of women empowerment, I’d like to honour those sisters who have been forced to lead a very difficult life due to ‘Triple Talaq’. There is no recourse for them, and such victims of ‘Triple Talaq’ have launched a massive movement in the country.  They shook the conscience of the intellectual class of the country, the media of the country also helped them and a movement against ‘Triple Talaq’ was started in the  country. I heartily commend those sisters who have launched this movement, who have been fighting against the ‘Triple Talaq’ and I’m confident that the country will help them in this struggle. The country will help these mothers and sisters in securing this right. India will fully support them and they will ultimately achieve success in this very important step in the direction of women empowerment; I am fully confident about this. 
My dear countrymen,  
Sometimes in the name of faith, some people due to lack of patience end up destroying the social fabric. The country is governed by peace, harmony and unity. The poison of casteism and communalism can never benefit the country. This is the land of Gandhi and Buddha, we have to move forward taking everyone along. This is a part of our country’s culture and tradition. We have to successfully carry it forward, and that is why in the name of faith, violence cannot be allowed.
If something happens to a patient in a hospital and the hospital is burnt down; some accident happens and the vehicles are burnt down; people launch a movement and the public property is burnt down; is it for a free India?  It is the property of 125 crore Indians. Whose cultural legacy is this? This is our cultural legacy, the legacy of 125 crore people. Whose faith is this? This is our faith, the faith of 125 crore people; and that is why the path of violence in the name of faith can never succeed in this country. The country will never accept this. And that is why I’d like to appeal to all the countrymen that at that time our motto was ‘Bharat Chodo’ and today’s slogan is ‘Bharat Jodo’. We have to take everyone and every section of the society along to take the country forward.  
In order to build a prosperous India, we need a strong economy, balanced development and next generation infrastructure. Only then, we  can realise the India of our dreams. 
Brothers and sisters,  
We have taken innumerable decisions over the past three years. Some have been noticed, while the rest may not have been noticed. But one thing is important - when you move towards big changes, you will face hurdles. But look at the working style of this government; when a train crosses a railway station and changes the track, the speed needs to be reduced from 60 to 30. The speed of the train decreases while changing the track. We are trying to put the whole country on a new track without decreasing the speed. We have maintained the speed.  
We may have brought a number of new laws and systems such as the GST, but we have successfully accomplished the task and the work goes on. 
We have laid emphasis on infrastructure.  We have invested lot of funds for building the infrastructure – from modernization of the railway station in a small town, to build an Airport, to expand water-ways or roadways, to form a gas-grid or a water-grid or to lay down an optical fibre network. We are emphasising on all types of modern infrastructure.
My dear countrymen, 
The prosperity of Eastern India is required for India’s forward movement into the 21st century. It has tremendous potential, rich human resources, immense natural wealth, work force and it has the power to change lives. We are devoting significant attention to eastern India- Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, and the Northeast. These parts have to grow further. These are abundant in natural resources and are striving hard to take the country to new heights. 
Brothers and sisters,  
Making India corruption-free is an important task and we are trying to provide impetus to it. After forming the government, our first task was to constitute an SIT. Today, after three years, I want to tell the countrymen proudly that we have unearthed black money worth Rs. 1.25 lakh crores, the culprits would be brought to book and forced to surrender.  
Demonetization followed this move. We have achieved several milestones through demonetization. The hidden black money has been brought into the formal economy. You must have seen that we used to extend the days from 7 days to 10 days to 15 days; sometimes we allowed the old notes at the petrol pump, at the chemist shops, and sometimes at the railway stations, because our intention was to bring all money into the formal banking system and we achieved success in completing the task. According to the research conducted by outside experts, about Rs.3 lakh crores that had never come into the banking system before, has been brought into the system after the demonetization. 
More than Rs. 1.75 lakh crores deposited in the banks is under the scanner. Black money worth Rs. 2 lakh crore had to be deposited in the banks and this system has forced them to be accountable. It   has also stopped the flow of black money. The number of new taxpayers filing income tax returns from April 01 to August 05 is 56 lakhs while in the same period last year only 22 lakh filed the returns.. In a way it has more than doubled. This is the result of our fight against black money. 
Over 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is much higher than what their declared income and therefore they have to clarify this. Around 4.5 lakh people have now come forward and are trying to trade the right path after accepting their mistakes. One lakh people, who had neither heard of Income Tax nor paid Income Tax, have now been forced to do so. 
Brothers and sisters,  
In our country, we tend to indulge in endless debates and discussions following the shutdown of companies.  People start speculating about economic meltdown and what not.  
You will be surprised to know that black marketers used to own shell companies. Post demonetization, the reports from data mining astonishingly revealed that there are 3 lakh shell companies dealing in Hawala transactions. Can anyone imagine? Out of these 3 lakh shell companies, registration of 1.75 lakh companies were cancelled.   
Even if five companies shut shop in India, there is huge public outcry. And here, we have closed one lakh Seventy five thousand companies. The looters of nation’s wealth will have to answer.  We have accomplished this task. 
You will be surprised to know that there are some shell companies operating from a single address. As many as 400 companies have been found to be operating from one address.  There was no one to question them. There was a total collusion.  
Therefore, Brothers and sisters, I have waged a big war against corruption and black money. We are fighting corruption - for the bright future of India and the wellbeing of our people.  
Brothers and sisters, 
We have taken several steps and I am sure that post GST, it will increase further and bring in transparency. Today a truck driver on an average is able to save 30% of his travel time from one point to another after GST was introduced. Hundreds of crores of rupees have been saved due to removal of check posts. This amounts to 30% increase in his efficiency. Can you imagine what it means to accomplish 30% more efficiency in the Indian transportation sector? GST has brought this revolutionary change.  
My dear countrymen,  
Today due to demonetization, banks have enough liquidity. Banks are reducing their interest rates. Even a common man is able to access inflow of funds through Mudra. He is getting opportunities to stand on his feet. The middle class and the underprivileged who aspire to have their own homes someday, are getting loans from the banks at low interest rates. Such moves are giving a fillip to the economic growth of the country.  
My dear countrymen,  
Time has changed. We are in the 21st Century. Our country boasts of the world’s largest youth population. 
India is known in the world for its prowess in IT and Digital World. Should we still remain in the old mind-set? There was a time when leather coins were in vogue, but gradually they ceased to exist. Today we have paper-currency. Slowly this paper-currency will be replaced by the digital currency. We should lead from the front to make a move towards Digital transactions. We should adopt BHIM App for transactions and make it a part of our economic activities. We should also work through prepaid systems. I am happy that there has been an increase in Digital transactions. It has increased by 34% compared to last year while the prepaid transactions have gone up by  44%. We should move towards a less-cash economy.  
My Dear Countrymen, some schemes of the Government are meant for ensuring savings for the common man. If you use LED bulbs, you can save Rs.2000 to Rs. 5000 per year. If we succeed in Swachh Bharat, poor will be able to save Rs. 7000 on medicines that they would otherwise have spent. Curbing inflation has helped people in saving money in a way.  
Cheap medicines through Jan Aushadhi Kendras are a boon to the poor. There used to be a lot of expenditure on operations and stents. We are striving to make it possible for knee operations as well. We are striving to minimize this expenditure for the poor and the middle class.  
Earlier there used to be Dialysis only at the State capitals. Now we have decided to open Dialysis Centres at district level. We have already opened this facility in 350 to 400 districts where free Dialysis services are available for the poor.  
We can take pride in the fact that we have developed various systems to showcase to the world. We have been able to develop the ‘NAVIC Navigation System’ through GPS. We have helped the neighbouring countries by successfully launching SAARC Satellite.  
We asserted our supremacy in the world by introducing Tejas aircraft. BHIM Aadhaar App for digital transaction has come as a surprise to the world. Crores of RuPay Cards are now available in the country. When all the cards will be operational, it will be the largest number of cards in the world.  
My dear countrymen, I shall urge you to take up the New India Pledge and move ahead.  Our scriptures say, “अनियत काल:, अनियत कालः प्रभुत्यो विपलवन्ते, प्रभुत्यो विपलवन्ते”.  It implies that, if we don’t accomplish a work within the stipulated time then we shall not be able to get the desired results. So for the ‘Team India’, for the 125 crore countrymen, we have to take the pledge to achieve the goal by 2022.  
We will do it with dedication to see a great, majestic India by 2022.   
So we will together build such an India where the poor will have Pucca House with electricity and water.  
Together we will build such an India where the farmers can sleep without worry. They will earn double by 2022 of what they are earning today. 
Together we will build such an India where the youth, the women will have enough opportunities to fulfil their dreams. 
Together we will build such an India which will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism. 
Together we will build such an India where nobody will compromise with corruption and nepotism.
Together we will build such an India which will be clean and healthy, and where the dream of Su-Raj will be fulfilled. 
And that is why my dear fellow countrymen, we will together strive to move ahead in this march towards development.  
Let all of us march together with the dream of a building an India of grandeur and majesty as we wait for the 75th year of independence after completing 70 years of Independence in the next five years.  
With this thought in mind I once again bow my head before the heroes of our freedom movement. I bow my head before the new confidence and passion of my 125 crore countrymen and I call upon Team India to march on with this new pledge.  
With this thought I convey my hearty congratulations to all of you. 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Vande Matram, Jai Hind
Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind
Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai,
Vande Matram, Vande Matram, Vande Matram, Vande Matram,
Thanking you all.

PMS INDEPENDENCE DAY ADDRESS

    FOLLOWING IS THE
ENGLISH RENDERING OF THE ADDRESS TO THE NATION IN HINDI BY THE PRIME MINISTER SHRI ATAL
BIHARI VAJPAYEE ON THE OCCASION OF 54th ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE DELIVERED
HERE TODAY FROM THE RAMPARTS OF RED FORT: -

""My dear countrymen,
You just now heard the melodious band of our Armed Forces. I convey my
greetings to all of you. We are celebrating the 54th anniversary of our
Independence. Today, we pay our respectful homage to the martyrs of the Freedom Struggle.
I would like to remember today all the great men and women of our Freedom Movement,
especially Mahatma Gandhi and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. They inspire and illuminate our
march in the new century.
On this occasion, I send my greetings to all the people of Indian
origin living in different corners of the world.
This nation of 100 crore people, inheriting a five thousand year old
civilization, is today scripting an illustrious chapter in its history.

Dear friends,

Remember the many hardships that we had to go through three years ago
in the aftermath of the nuclear tests at Pokharan. Today, those difficulties are receding.

We faced those hardships for the sake of our national security, and we
did so successfully. Today our relations with many important countries of the world have
grown stronger and deeper. We are engaged in a Strategic Dialogue with them on a regular
basis. 
Indias prestige has gone up globally.

Sisters and brothers,

We have always been strong votaries of world peace. For thousands of
years, we have been chanting the mantra of peace.  Prithvih Shantih, Antariksha
Shantih, Vanaspatayah Shantih   praying for peace on earth, in outer
space, and also peace for all the flora and fauna.
Naturally, we have always desired to have peaceful relations with all
our neighbours. The entire world knows that India has left no stone unturned to improve
her relations with Pakistan. These efforts have been continuing right from the days of
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Many Agreements and Declarations were signed. But these have not
helped to establish lasting peace.
I, too, attempted to make a new beginning. I went to Lahore for peace. 
Yet, despite having signed the Lahore Declaration, Pakistan committed
an armed aggression at Kargil. Our jawans, with their bravery and heroism, threw them out
of our territory. I pay my tribute to all those soldiers who laid their lives in that
conflict. I express my deep sympathies with their families on this occasion.
Despite Kargil and cross-border terrorism, we invited Pakistans
President General Pervez Musharraf for talks 
I told my guest in Agra: ""We have been fighting for 50 years. For
how many years more, you intend to fight? This has helped neither Pakistan nor India.
Because of the hostile relations, both our countries are spending a lot of their limited
resources on wars and for preparing for wars, whereas we ought to be spending these scarce
resources on the development of our two countries and to improve the lives of our
peoples.""
I had also told him: ""If we have to fight, why dont we wage
a war against poverty, against unemployment, against disease, and against
underdevelopment."" 
We know that the people of Pakistan yearn for peace with India.
We have to promote cooperation in trade, economics, and in other areas
for mutual benefit. We have to encourage greater people-to-people contacts. 
Unfortunately, President Musharraf had no interest in improving our
relations in all possible areas. He came here with a single-point agenda  to make
India accept Pakistans terms on Kashmir.
I could not have accepted this condition.
He wanted us to forget the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration,
and begin a new journey from Agra.
I could not have accepted this too.
He kept on describing cross-border terrorism as ""jehad"" and
""freedom struggle"". 
There was simply no question of accepting this logic. 
As we had expected, there has been a spurt in terrorist activities
after the Agra Summit. There have been massacres of innocent people in Amarnath, Kishtwar,
Doda, Jammu and yesterday near Ghaziabad.
What kind of jehad is this? What kind of freedom struggle is this? And,
for whom is this freedom struggle? 
The activities of Pakistan-supported Jehadi organizations are napak
(unholy). They are against the tenets of Islam and humanism. 
Let no one entertain any delusion that Pakistan can succeed in wresting
Kashmir, through jehad and terrorism, what it has failed to get through wars.
As far as the dialogue with Pakistan is concerned, India shall continue
to be engaged in this process. Nevertheless, we shall not hesitate in the least to crush
Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.
Today I wish to tell the people of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh that we
feel your pain and agony. We have been making all efforts to remove it. 
We shall intensify the efforts that we have been making to bring
normalcy to the State and to bring the fruits of development to its people. Panchayat
elections have been held in the State recently. The people of the Jammu and Kashmir will
elect a new Assembly, after some time. We shall ensure free and fair elections to the
State Assembly. 
On this occasion, I recall the couplets of the great Shayar-e-Kashmir,
Mehjoor. Its gist I would recall here:- 

The caste and land of you Kashmiris is the same. Do not unnecessarily let
anything create a distance between you. If Muslim is milk, Hindu is sugar. Mix this milk
with this sugar. 

This Sufi ideology is the convergence point of Kashmir with the
spiritual tradition of India. Kashmiriyat is a fine example of Sarva Dharma Samabhava
(secularism). It completely negates the Two-Nation theory. We are indeed proud of this
Kashmiriyat. 
The situation in the North-Eastern States is a matter of special
concern to us. Violence complicates problems; it does not solve them. It has created
hurdles in the path of development of the North-East.
Today I would like to reassure my sisters and brothers in the
North-East that the comprehensive peace process, that we have begun in the region, will
bear desired results. 
India is a vast nation. It is multi-lingual and multi-religious. It is
full of myriad diversities. 
These diversities are not our weakness. Rather, they are our strength.
They showcase our cultural richness. In these diversities lie the powerful threads of
Indias unity.

Sisters and brothers,

India is one of the ten fastest growing economies in the world. In
terms of size, India is counted among the four largest economies of the world. 
India has emerged as one of the front-ranking nations in the world in
information technology, missile technology, and in many other areas. 
When I see young women and men, of the new generation handling high
responsibilities with aplomb, my faith in Indias future gets strengthened. It is
these people who are making India a better place than before. They are the architects of
Indias strong and glorious tomorrow.
Now we can truly take pride in being Indian. Indians can walk with
their heads held high in the world.
In spite of the population having more than trebled in the past five
decades, we have been able to reduce the percentage of people living below the poverty
line. 
In the decade of the 90s, it has fallen from 36 percent to 26
percent. 
I do not claim that we have been able to eradicate poverty as rapidly
as we should, or could, have.
But I am confident that abject poverty is on its way out in India. 
In the last decade, literacy in India has taken a quantum jump. I am
confident that in the current decade, India will more or less become completely literate. 
It is true that Indias economy is currently going through a
slowdown. But this is a temporary phenomenon.
This is also a global phenomenon, and not limited to India alone.
But there is no need to get too worried on this score, because the
fundamental indicators of India's economy are quite strong.
Prices are stable. Inflation is under control. Foreign exchange
reserves are at a record high. And, our godowns are bursting with foodgrains.
Because of good monsoon, there are bright prospects of the coming crops
on the economic front. Yesterdays heavy rainfall had cast doubts that the morning
today will be full of dark clouds and the earth will be soaked with the rain showers. But,
this did not happen. Clouds have dispersed and the sun has come out. We can now forge
ahead towards future. Good monsoon has come with promising prospects on the economic
front.
We have taken steps to increase investment in all the infrastructure
areas, in industries, and in agriculture. We shall soon take more steps in this direction.
These will help in bringing the economic slowdown to an end.
In the past few years, natural calamities seem to have resolved to test
India. Orissa was hit by a super-cyclone. In Gujarat there was a devastating earthquake.
Some parts of the country have faced severe floods, and at some places there is drought.
Now, the task of their rehabilitation is taking place on a large scale with the
cooperation of all. We thank the foreign countries and are grateful to them for the speed
with which they came forward with help. This symbolises that entire humanity is one and if
any of its part is suffering, then the entire body feels the pain. All therefore should
rush to extend help unitedly. Nevertheless, together we have encountered these crises with
great fortitude and solidarity and provided relief to the affected. 
We are going to put in place a permanent and institutional structure to
effectively deal with such natural calamities. 

My dear kisan brothers,

You are the countrys annadata.
With your hard work, you have not only made India self-sufficient in
foodgrains, but have produced a big surplus. Scarcity of foodgrains has become a thing of
the past now. Earlier, we used to import food. Now, we are an exporter.
Today, the Governments godowns have a stock of more than 60
million tonnes of foodgrains. We are augmenting the storage capacity. 
I am well aware of the many problems that our farmers are grappling
with. We have been constantly trying to mitigate them. It has been our endeavour to ensure
that the kisan gets fair and remunerative price for his crops. 
So far, more than one and a half crore farmers have been given Kisan
Credit Cards. 
Some people have been expressing apprehensions that cheap farm imports
will flood Indian markets because of our commitments to the WTO. These have been proved
false.
We are quite capable, depending on our needs, to impose or hike import
duties and to check unfair imports. We have, in fact, done so in some cases. 
It is true that a new scenario of world trade is emerging. This has
presented many challenges to Indian agriculture and to the rest of our economy. We can
 and we shall  face these challenges through collective and coordinated
action.
I appeal to all our farmers, workers, managers, businessmen, scientists
and researchers to prepare our economy to face global competition more vigorously. For
this, our agriculture and industries have to constantly improve their quality. They also
have to significantly reduce their production costs.

Friends,

This year marks the decade of India's New Economic Policy. 
This policy has brought many gains to our economy. At the same time,
however, several new problems have also cropped up. 
It is true that certain recent developments have highlighted some of
the weaknesses in our financial and capital markets. This has made people feel rather
worried. 
We have taken several steps to remove these weaknesses, and we shall
take more steps in the future.
The functioning of the stockmarkets and financial institutions will be
reformed to protect the interests of small investors.
Profits earned by hook or by crook cannot be the sole criterion for
judging the success of a business. The success of liberalization requires the steady
development of a new corporate ethic. 

Brothers and sisters,

Some cases of corruption and scandals have surfaced in recent times. We
cannot turn a blind eye to corruption, nor can we let corruption proliferate. A corrupt
man must receive punishment for his deeds.
I reassure you that corrupt elements will not be able to escape the
long arm of the law, irrespective of how high a chair they may occupy. Only yesterday, a
new Bill  Lok Pal Bill has been introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister has
also been included in its ambit, if there are any corruption charges against him. Our
Government will not discriminate in any way in this regard and will not hesitate, if need
be, in putting to trial any person, however big or powerful he may be. We have already
taken strong action in several cases.
At the same time, I wish to state that there is a need to refrain from
giving baseless allegations the color of a scandal. I know that most people in our country
believe in earning their livelihood by honest means.

Dear Countrymen,

This year marks a decade of New Economic Policy of India. There is no
doubt that economic liberalization has benefited India. At the same time, this too is true
that the fruits of liberalization have not adequately reached the poor and people living
in rural areas. Inequalities have increased. 
Therefore, after serious introspection, my Government has decided to
give a new pro-poor, pro-village, and pro-employment orientation to our economic policy.
We shall make necessary modifications in the policy to remove regional
imbalances and social inequalities.
We are determined to ensure that the new economic policy becomes a
promoter of social justice and that its benefits reach our brothers and sisters belonging
to Dalit, Adivasi, backward, and most backward sections of our society.
We have unveiled several important schemes towards this end in the past
three years. In the same direction, we now propose to take some new measures: - 



The Central Government will launch an ambitious new scheme of Rs. 10,000 crore to
    provide additional and guaranteed employment in rural areas. This centrally sponsored
    scheme will be called the Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana. 


Under this scheme, those who take employment from panchayats to build
  durable rural assets will be paid wages in cash and in foodgrains. For this, 50 lakh
  tonnes of foodgrains worth Rs. 5,000 crore will be provided to State Governments every
  year. All the existing employment schemes of the Central Government will be merged into
  this mega-scheme. Nearly one hundred crore mandays of employment are expected to be
  generated through the Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana. 


Our economy shows a strange paradox. Nearly all the savings of our people are deposited
    in banks. The banks are unable to use these funds fully for developmental projects. 


On the other hand, the unorganized sector of the economy does not get
  adequate bank credit. This sector constitutes two-thirds of our economy. The loan
  repayment record of this sector is indeed better than that of big industries. We are
  considering some institutional measures to make resources available to the unorganized
  businesses and industries.


Neither faster development, nor peoples participation is possible without
    decentralization. Which is why, two important amendments to the Constitution were enacted
    nearly ten years ago to empower the Panchayati Raj Institutions. However, we have so far
    not been able to devolve the necessary powers to the Panchayati Raj Institutions to
    empower them financially and administratively in an adequate manner.


The Government will soon initiate a national debate to achieve this
  important objective, involving all the over thirty lakh elected representatives in
  Panchayati Raj institutions. We would like the Panchayats to fix their own priorities,
  prepare their own plans, and to implement them with the participation of the villagers.
  Towards this end, we shall devise new ways to enable Panchayati Raj institutions and
  non-governmental organizations engaged in rural developmental activities to avail loans
  from banks and other financial institutions for specific development projects. 


All of us know that democracy and hunger cannot go together. We shall therefore launch a
    National Nutrition Mission. Under this, subsidized foodgrains will be made
    available to adolescent girls and expectant and nursing mothers, belonging to
    below-poverty-line families. Cheaper foodgrains could also be provided to such religious,
    social, and educational organizations if they so require, that are engaged in mass-feeding
    programmes for the poor.



Friends, India is urbanizing rapidly. As a result, there is a growing shortage of
    affordable housing for the urban poor. The Government has, therefore, decided to launch Ambedkar
     Valmiki Malin Basti Awas Yojana, to benefit especially those belonging to the
    scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, backward classes, and other weaker sections. The
    Ministry of Urban Development will give a yearly grant of Rs. 1,000 crore to this project.
    HUDCO, which will implement this scheme, will make available another Rs. 2,000 crore as a
    loan amount.


There is a shortage of three lakh housing units for the families of the
  jawans in our Armed Forces. At the present rate of housing construction, it will take
  thirty years for this shortage to end. We have decided to build these three lakh housing
  units in the next four years. 


I had mentioned, in my Address to the Nation on Independence Day last year, about the Pradhan
    Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana. This is now being implemented in almost all the States. So
    far, the Centre has made Rs. 5,000 crore available for this project. This project would
    need Rs. 60,000 crore for completion. It is our aim to provide all-weather road
    connectivity to all villages and hamlets in the country, with a population of more than
    five hundred, by the end of the Tenth Five Year Plan in 2007. 


The National Highways Development Project of Rs. 55,000 crore is
  one of the ambitious projects of independent India. We shall further intensify the work on
  this project. I am confident that these two major road connectivity programmes would
  create lakhs of new employment opportunities and also give our economy a big boost.


Our objective is Freedom from Distance. We are, therefore, determined to link all
    the villages of India not only with good roads, but also with good telecom and Internet
    services. A lot of progress has taken place in this regard in the past two years. We shall
    further accelerate this work.


Small and cottage industries are a big source of employment. The Khadi and Village
    Industries Commission (KVIC) alone provides employment to more than sixty lakh people
    under its various units. It has added six lakh new employment opportunities during the
    past three years. We shall take many new measures to strengthen the KVIC. We have also
    launched effective steps to popularize khadi and village industry products in foreign
    markets. 


Tourism is a big source of employment generation and foreign exchange earning. Indeed,
    it is the fastest growing industry in the world today. 


To achieve this end, we shall unveil a progressive National Tourism
  Policy before the end of this year. 


Friends, our entire society, and especially poor people are fed up with the long delays
    and other deficiencies in our judicial system. The Government has set up over 1,700
    Fast-Track Courts to reduce the mountain of long pending cases. 


We shall soon take necessary steps to repeal or amend all laws and
  rules, which hurt the interests of the poor. We shall also review all those procedures and
  practices, which unfortunately have tended to make the poor targets of harassment by
  agencies of the Government 


The Government is committed to the goal of ""Health For All"". After the
    unprecedented success of the polio vaccination campaign, the Government has decided to
    soon start similar mass campaigns against leprosy, tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/AIDS, and
    other such diseases. 


In recent years, there has been a great interest, both in India and
  abroad, in Ayurveda and other Indian systems of medicine. We are considering making
  available a low-cost kit containing certain traditional medicines and herbal products,
  which have proved their efficacy over centuries in treating many common ailments. I urge
  our kisans and pharmaceutical companies to seize this new opportunity created by the
  growing worldwide attraction for Ayurvedic products and Indian systems of medicine. 


We are observing this year as Womens Empowerment Year. Therefore, we shall
    impart greater momentum to the implementation of all the programmes aimed at the welfare
    of our mothers, sisters, and girls. I especially wish to congratulate the Self Help Groups
    started by women, which have begun a silent socio-economic revolution. There are many
    success stories in India, and also in the South Asian region, where Self Help Groups
    using micro-credit from banks have made a significant dent in rural and urban poverty. 


Therefore, the Government has decided to facilitate the setting up of
  at least one self-help group in each of the 14 lakh habitations in the country, by the end
  of 2004.
We have taken yet another major decision for womens economic
  empowerment. Over the next three years, all public-sector banks will lend five percent of
  the net bank credit to women entrepreneurs. This will make Rs. 17,000 crore of bank credit
  available for women-sponsored businesses.



While launching these new initiatives, we are acutely
aware of one fact. Usually, the Government prepares schemes and programmes but finds that
the system is inadequate to the task of implementing them in an effective and time-bound
manner.
The Government has, therefore, decided to observe the coming year as
the Year of Implementation. 
Towards this end, we shall constitute a Rapid Action Force to
monitor the implementation of various poverty-alleviation and employment generation
programmes. 
Children are the most precious wealth of our nation. Ten years ago,
representing India in the World Conference for Children, I had argued for greater
investments for all-round development of children. However, the agencies of the Government
alone cannot achieve this. I earnestly appeal to all voluntary organizations, businesses,
and common citizens to ensure that we together enable every child in India to develop to
their fullest potential. 
Next month, there is a special session of the United Nations General
Assembly on children. India will reiterate her commitment to childrens welfare at
this important forum.

Friends,
There is political stability in the country. There is a thriving
democracy. In a big country like ours, there are bound to be small and not-so-small
problems. Political opposition is natural in a democracy, but there should be no
opposition for the sake of opposition.
There is full freedom in our country for political parties,
intellectuals, and the media to express their views. This is, indeed, a matter of pride
for us. It is only such freedom that nurtures and strengthens the roots of democracy. 
However, freedom comes with responsibility. Our democracy demands of
all of us that we discharge our responsibilities conscientiously, and that we respect
proper norms.

Brothers and sisters,

We are all citizens of an India that is on her way to attaining
greatness. We should have confidence in Indias future. We should have faith in
ourselves. We should have trust in our own hands and in our own brains. Trust is a
resource. It has been my endeavour and the endeavour of my Government that we nurture
mutual trust. Trust should not be broken. Nobody should come in the way of building mutual
trust. 
It is only on the strength of mutual trust, cooperation, and
coexistence that we can create a future of hope for India.
Come, let us together resolve today to build a united, strong,
prosperous and a caring India.

Jai Hind!
Jai Hind!
Jai Hind!""

TEXT OF PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS ON INDEPENDENCE 
                DAY-20


Following 
                is the English rendering of the Address to the Nation by the Prime 
                Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee from the ramparts of Red Fort 
                on the occasion of Independence Day today:
""Dear 
                countrymen,
My hearty Independence 
                Day greetings to all of you. 
My felicitations,


To the brave soldiers of the three 
                  Armed Forces and to all our security forces.


To our hard-working kisans and 
                  diligent workers.


I greet our scientists, 
                teachers, and our sisters and mothers whose awakening has unleashed 
                Indias Woman Power. 
And, dear children, 
                you are the future of our Nation. Lots of love to you, and my 
                blessings.
Members of Indias 
                Diaspora, living in distant lands of the world, my good wishes 
                to all of you. You may be far away from India, but you are always 
                close to our hearts. 
I wish to congratulate 
                all our sportspersons, who did India proud in the recent Commonwealth 
                Games. In particular, our women who have shown that they are in 
                no way behind men. I am confident that Indian sportspersons will 
                earn similar success in the Olympic Games.
Sisters and 
                Brothers,
It is fifty-five years 
                since we became independent. Today, we pay our homage to all the 
                martyrs of the Freedom Struggle. We bow our heads before Mahatma 
                Gandhi, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, and all other great leaders.
We salute our soldiers, 
                jawans of paramilitary forces, and police personnel who laid down 
                their lives in combating terrorism. 
Our tributes also 
                to the martyrs who foiled the terrorist attack on our Parliament 
                on December 13. 
Terrorism has become 
                a festering wound. It is an enemy of humanity.
Our neighbour claims 
                to oppose terrorism at the international level, but adopts double 
                standards in the context of our region. After facing defeat in 
                wars, it has resorted to cross-border terrorism for grabbing Kashmir. 
                
We wish to state once 
                again that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. It 
                will remain so. 
The world cannot accept 
                that the cruel massacre of the Amarnath pilgrims, or the carnage 
                of innocent women and children at Kaluchak and Kasim Nagar are 
                a part of any ""Freedom Struggle"". 
For us, Kashmir is 
                not a piece of land; it is a test-case of Sarva Dharma Samabhava 
                 secularism. India has always stood the test of a secular 
                nation. Jammu and Kashmir is a living example of this. And this 
                itself is Kashmiriyat. 
We shall defeat cross-border 
                terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. This is our resolve. 
We wish to have good 
                neighborly relations with Pakistan. The Lahore Journey and the 
                Agra Summit are a testimony to this. 
India wants all issues 
                to be resolved peacefully and through negotiations. We are prepared 
                to take some more steps in this direction. However, for this, 
                it is necessary to create a conducive environment. 
Infiltration into 
                Jammu and Kashmir continues even today. Those who call the forthcoming 
                elections in the State farcical should not give us lectures on 
                democracy. Let them take a look at their own track record. 
How can attempts to 
                flagrantly provoke the people of Jammu and Kashmir to boycott 
                elections create an atmosphere for any meaningful talks. Instead 
                of resolving problems, this will only exacerbate them.
Sisters and 
                Brothers,
I am deeply saddened 
                when I compare South Asia with other parts of the world. When 
                Japan, which was devastated in the Second World War, today stands 
                as one of the front-ranking nations; when the whole of Europe 
                has united, forgetting all the old enmities; why cant we resolve 
                all our contentious issues through talks?
We can. We will. 
Why cant we unite 
                and fight against our real enemy, the poverty? 
This is a challenge. 
                No one is going to come from outside and meet it for us.
***
The process of peace 
                and democracy has now arrived at a decisive turn in Jammu and 
                Kashmir, which has been grappling with terrorism. 
Elections are going 
                to take place in the State. The dates have already been announced. 
                
I am confident that 
                these elections will be fully free and fair. No one need have 
                any doubts on this score. 
I appeal to the people 
                of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh, as also to their representatives 
                to participate actively and in large numbers in the elections 
                and thereby demolish the motivated propaganda being conducted 
                from across the border.
No one will be allowed 
                to create disturbances in the elections in Jammu and Kashmir. 
                All the designs to create an atmosphere of fear will be frustrated.
The people of Jammu 
                and Kashmir want to live in peace. For many many years they have 
                seen and suffered violence and bloodshed. They want to create 
                a future for their children.
My brothers and sisters 
                in Jammu and Kashmir, today is an opportunity when we can together 
                heal these wounds. Together, we can participate in the creation 
                of a happy Jammu and Kashmir.
I would like that 
                no citizen of the State feels alone and helpless. The entire Nation 
                is with them. 
I am confident that 
                all the displaced people, including Kashmiri Pandits, will be 
                able to go back to their homes with respect, in the new situation 
                that will be created after the elections.
I wish to assure the 
                people of Jammu and Kashmir that if any mistakes have occurred, 
                we shall make amends. For this, we shall talk to the elected representatives 
                and organizations. Discussions will also take place on the demand 
                for more powers to the State.

The desire for peace 
                is growing in Indias North-Eastern States too. The demand for 
                faster economic development is intensifying.
People are realizing 
                the fact that the gun can snatch away life, but it cannot make 
                peoples lives better.
Our efforts for permanent 
                peace in Nagaland are progressing towards success. We invite all 
                those who have taken to the path of violence in other North-Eastern 
                States for peace talks.
Sisters and 
                Brothers,
In addition to external 
                difficulties, we also have had to grapple with nature. A large 
                part of the country is reeling under a severe drought. In some 
                places, floods have shown their wrath. 
Standing crops are 
                wilting, sown seeds have gone bad. Kisans are concerned. We share 
                their concern.
The Government has 
                taken every possible step to deal effectively with the drought. 
                Our godowns are brimming with foodgrains. We will not let anyone 
                die of hunger. 
Relief is being reached 
                to the weaker sections of society by extending the scope of the 
                Antyodaya Anna Yojana. Under the Rs. 10,000-crore Sampoorna 
                Grameen Rozgar Yojana, drought relief programmes are being 
                speedily implemented. Five thousand crore rupees have been given 
                to States to undertake various ""Food-for-Work"" activities. 
                
Prices of essential 
                goods are under control.
But all these are 
                temporary measures.
The Government is 
                now preparing an effective, long-term strategy to protect the 
                country from the curse of drought and floods.
We will make concerted 
                efforts to save every drop of water. We will have to adopt watershed 
                management, rainwater harvesting, and all such techniques. 
We will shortly unveil 
                a new initiative, which will be called Pradhan Mantri Grameen 
                Jal Samvardhan Yojana. 
We shall soon start 
                three important programmes: 


One lakh hand-pumps will be installed 
                  in water-scarce areas; 


One lakh primary schools in rural 
                  areas will be provided with drinking water facilities; and,


One lakh traditional sources of 
                  drinking water will be revived.


Dear Countrymen,
With your trust, affection, 
                and support, I am in front of you for the fifth consecutive year 
                on the ramparts of Red Fort. 
There is stability 
                in the country today. People want the experiment of coalition 
                governance to succeed. 
Democracy has become 
                stronger. Its roots have reached every village and town. After 
                Independence, thirteen elections to the Lok Sabha have taken place. 
                Governments have been formed and changed, but always without any 
                bloodshed and violence.
My Government is committed 
                to carrying out electoral reforms. It is our firm resolve to keep 
                criminal elements away from power.

Dear Countrymen,
Today, India stands 
                proudly on the world stage  tall, self-reliant, and full of self-confidence. 
                Our prestige is on the rise internationally. 
It is necessary that 
                we do not overlook our achievements. Undoubtedly, our progress 
                in certain areas has been tardy. We have to honestly introspect 
                on this. For, we have the potential to achieve much more than 
                what we have achieved so far. 
Sometimes, we tend 
                to talk about our shortcomings much more than is necessary. This 
                gives rise to disappointment. The Nations energy dissipates.
On the other hand, 
                the feeling of national pride inspires us to work to achieve more. 
                
We are proud of our 
                kisans. Until a few years ago, we had had to import foodgrains 
                from abroad. Last year, we exported foodgrains worth Rs. 6,400 
                crore. 
We are proud of our 
                scientists and engineers. They successfully launched into space 
                not only Indian satellites, but also satellites of other countries.
We are proud 
                of our entrepreneurs in the computer industry. Could anyone have 
                even imagined that one day, India would earn Rs. 40,000 crore 
                in computer software exports? But it has happened.
Behind these achievements, 
                is the talent, the hard work, and the determination of us Indians. 
                The credit for this goes especially to the youth of our country. 
                Come, let us congratulate our younger generation for this.
Sisters and 
                Brothers,
We have a multi-party 
                system. The race for power is natural in this system. However, 
                this race has to remain within the limits of the ""Nation 
                First"" principle. 
We will have to draw 
                a Lakshman Rekha in our political conduct. This 
                must never be crossed for temporary gains. 
Today, there is consensus 
                among political parties on issues of national security. Then, 
                why cant we create a similar consensus on certain pressing issues 
                of social and economic development?
We can create this 
                consensus. We must create this consensus.
Take for example, 
                the problems in the power sector. The scarcity of electricity 
                has assumed crisis proportions in many States. 
I appeal to all political 
                parties to arrive at a consensus on the minimum agenda for power 
                sector reforms.
However, it is not 
                enough to change the mindset of political parties. It is 
                also necessary to bring about a change in the mindset of the 
                people. 
Just think of the 
                extensive theft of power, and of the Rs. 25,000 crore that is 
                lost through it every year. How can this be tolerated?
Today, 
                kisans want quality power; they are willing to pay more if the 
                power supply is uninterrupted. But there should be no interruptions 
                and cuts and no impediments in its transmission to the 
                desired destinations. 
Countrymen,
The economic reforms 
                that have been implemented in the past few years are in front 
                of you. An economy of scarcity has been transformed into 
                an economy of surplus. 


Today, there are no crowds in front 
                  of ration shops.


There are no lines for gas and 
                  telephone connections


The queues for kerosene have become 
                  shorter.


Prices of vegetables 
                may have risen in rainy season, but we have strived to keep onion 
                prices in check! 
Telecom and Internet 
                services are available to more and more people. Their rates too 
                are continuously falling. 
Our chief objective 
                of economic reforms has been to remove poverty speedily. We are 
                moving rapidly in this direction. The living standards of the 
                common man are rising. Today, a fan, a TV, a refrigerator, or 
                a scooter can be seen even in poor localities.
My dream is to see 
                that every family has its own house. In the past four years, we 
                have initiated the process of construction of nearly sixty lakh 
                new houses. Of these, 35 lakh houses are in rural areas and eighty 
                percent are for poor families. 
I dream of an India 
                in which both the Government and Society are sensitive. Our policies 
                and programmes have been formulated with this end in mind. 
Brothers and 
                Sisters,
Faster development 
                of the infrastructure in our country is the need of the hour. 
                We are fully determined to ensure that this happens.
A network of world-class 
                highways is being laid across the country. The National Highways 
                Development Project is being implemented rapidly. Rs. 55,000 crore 
                will be spent on it. This is the biggest and most ambitious road 
                project to be implemented in India after Sher Shah Suris Grand 
                Trunk Road.
Similarly, the Pradhan 
                Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, costing Rs. 60,000 crore, will link 
                every village with an all-weather road in five years. 
These two road projects 
                are generating jobs for lakhs of people.

Dear Countrymen,
Our aim is to free 
                India from the curse of poverty and unemployment. It is to make 
                India a Developed Nation by 2020.
When this country 
                of one billion people works with a common resolve, then no goal 
                is impossible to achieve. 
The Tenth Plan has 
                set the target of eight percent yearly growth in GDP.
We are taking some 
                important new measures for economic and social development. These 
                will be announced separately today. 
Sisters and 
                Brothers,
I appeal to you to 
                display the same emotional unity on the issue of National Development 
                as you always do on the issue of National Security.
Come, let us make 
                Development a powerful Peoples Movement.
For this, it is necessary 
                that everyone rises above casteism and communalism. We will have 
                to leave behind all those things that divide us.
The horrific explosion 
                of communal violence in Gujarat was one unfortunate example of 
                this. There can be no place for such violence in a civilized society.
We must maintain peace, 
                communal amity, national unity and integrity even in the most 
                serious and provocative of circumstances. 
It is the responsibility 
                of the Government and Society alike to provide security and equal 
                opportunities for the minorities.
Countrymen,
Come, let us as a 
                nation look ahead, look to the future.
Someone has rightly 
                said: 
""Beeti Tahi 
                Bisar De, Aage Ki Sudh Le""
(Forget what happened 
                in the past, look forward to the future.)
Rather than getting 
                bogged down in the issues and disputes of the past, let us create 
                a new future for ourselves.
All our programmes 
                will succeed and all our dreams for progress will come true only 
                when we strictly adhere to probity and morality in public life.
We will not compromise 
                with corruption at any level. Those who are in high offices should 
                remember that people expect equally high conduct from them.
While on the one hand, 
                there is a need for those in politics and administration to change 
                their behaviour, equally, our citizens need to change their attitude.
Do not talk only of 
                your rights. Remember also your own duties and responsibilities.
The mindset of depending 
                on the Government for every work has to change. 
I call upon all citizens 
                and voluntary organizations to come forward for social work.
***
It is our collective 
                responsibility to ensure that Dalits, oppressed, and people belonging 
                to backward classes enjoy social justice and equality. We do not 
                do them any favour by doing this. 
My Government has 
                extended the period of reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled 
                tribes in government service for another ten years. Their opportunities 
                for promotion in government service have also been properly ensured.
These reservations 
                are not a dole, rather they are an instrument for bringing about 
                social equality.
My dear countrymen,
This fifty-fifth anniversary 
                of Independence conveys one more message to us. And that message 
                is that all of us strive to our utmost for the realization of 
                the dream of making India a Developed Nation.


May our goal be the limitless heights 
                  of the sky.


May our feet be on the ground.


May our minds be full of unyielding 
                  determination.


May our hands be clasped together.


May our resolve be to march together.


If we do this, our 
                victory is certain.
Come, let all of us 
                unitedly affirm this resolve with the victorious salutation of 
                Jai Hind.
Join me in saying 
                thrice:
Jai Hind! Jai Hind!! 
                Jai Hind!!!""

                PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS ON INDEPENDENCE DAY-2003 
              
Following is the 
                English rendering of the Address to the Nation by the Prime Minister, 
                Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee from the ramparts of Red Fort on the 
                occasion of Independence Day today: 
""Dear countrymen,
My hearty greetings 
                to all of you on the sacred occasion of our Independence Day.

Each year on this 
                day, we gather at the Red Fort and unfurl our beloved Tricolor. 
                The Tricolor is a symbol of our freedom, of our self-respect, 
                and of sacrifices and martyrdom.

People belonging 
                to the older generations would certainly remember the time when 
                young boys and girls would form themselves into small groups, 
                take the flag in their hands, and go around villages and city 
                streets singing, Vijayi Vishwa Tiranga Pyara, Jhanda Uncha 
                Rahe Hamara. (May our beloved and victorious Tricolor fly 
                high in the world.)

Today we bow our 
                heads in homage to the memory of all the leaders, fighters, and 
                martyrs of our Freedom Struggle.

My greetings to all 
                the jawans of the three Armed Forces and to the security personnel. 
                We gratefully remember those brave soldiers who laid down their 
                lives while guarding our frontiers or in the battle against terrorism.

This year the festival 
                of freedom has arrived bringing the message of good rains in most 
                parts of the country. We hope that the areas, which have not yet 
                received adequate rainfall, would do so.

The last year went 
                by in grappling with the crisis of drought. We assisted all the 
                drought-hit areas to the fullest extent, sent adequate foodgrains 
                there, and ensured that there was no hunger anywhere. We also 
                took care of the mute cattle.

Felicitations to 
                our farmers, who with their hard work, have filled the granaries 
                in the country.

Felicitations to 
                our industrious workers, skilled managers, and far-sighted businessmen, 
                whose successes have attracted the attention of the entire world. 
                Today, Indias economy has grown to be the fourth largest in the 
                world.

Greetings to all 
                scientists, teachers, litterateurs, artistes, and to dear children.

Felicitations to 
                all the people of Indian origin living abroad. They have made 
                a remarkable contribution to raising Indias stature in the world. 
                We are proud of them.

Today, we offer our 
                salutations to Mother India, whose children we all are. Whatever 
                be our religion, caste, region, or language, we all are one. This 
                unity is our strength. 

We should cherish 
                the diversity that underpins this unity. But we must, under all 
                circumstances and at any cost, keep our national unity and integrity 
                intact. This is the most important message of Independence Day.

Sisters and 
                brothers, this is the sixth consecutive time that I have 
                been speaking to you from the ramparts of this historic Red Fort. 
                This has been possible only because of your affection and support.

The dream of India 
                as a great nation, which we had seen during the Freedom Struggle, 
                continues to inspire us even today. To some extent, this dream 
                has been realized. Yet, a lot more remains to be accomplished.

Despite all the hardships, 
                and braving all the challenges in these fifty-six years, India 
                is standing in the world with her head held high.

The nations security 
                is supreme to us. India cannot be dependent on others for her 
                security. Therefore, the first act of my Government five years 
                ago was to make India, for her self-defence, a nuclear weapons 
                state.

The world is changing. 
                New challenges are emerging before us. We have to make India stronger 
                both economically and socially. 

In the past five 
                years, Indias prestige in the world has gone up, thanks to our 
                pro-active foreign policy. The international communitys way of 
                looking at us has undergone a big change. The world is now recognizing 
                India: 



As the worlds largest democracy;


As an emerging global economic 
                  power;


As the confluence of a modern 
                  nation and an ancient civilization;


As a powerful country, dedicated 
                  to the ideal of peace.



Sisters and 
                brothers, it is our policy to establish friendly and cooperative 
                relations with all our neighbors. We believe in resolving all 
                disputes peacefully. Our frequent initiatives to normalize relations 
                with Pakistan are not a sign of our weakness; rather, they are 
                an indication of our commitment to peace.

In recent months, 
                there has been some progress in normalizing relations with Pakistan. 
                Nevertheless, terrorist activities are still continuing. The test 
                of our neighbours sincerity lies in whether he is prepared to 
                stop cross-border terrorism totally. 

We hope that Pakistan 
                abjures its anti-India outlook. The people of both countries wish 
                to live in peace.

I have been telling 
                our Pakistani friends that we have spent fifty years fighting. 
                How much more blood is yet to be spilt? The two of us need to 
                fight against poverty, against unemployment, and against backwardness.

We should increase 
                trade and economic links between our two countries. When we share 
                a two thousand kilometer long border, it makes no sense for us 
                to trade via a third country.

Let people travel 
                to and fro. Let more and more elected representatives visit each 
                others country. Let us expand bilateral cultural relations. 

Let us open some 
                new doors, new windows, and new light-holes in the walls that 
                divide us.

The love that the 
                two-year-old girl Noor from Lahore received in India carries a 
                message, which our friends in Pakistan should understand.

On the occasion of 
                Independence Day of both our countries, I invite Pakistan to walk 
                together with India on the road to peace. This road is decidedly 
                bumpy. There are even mines strewn along this path. Yet, once 
                we start walking, we will find the hurdles getting out of our 
                way.

I had gone to Srinagar 
                a few months back. Im going there again at the end of this month. 
                The atmosphere there is changing. 

Last year, from the 
                ramparts of this very Red Fort, I had declared that elections 
                in the State would be held on time, and that they would be free 
                and fair. Not everybody believed in it then. But, we fulfilled 
                our promise.

The free elections 
                there have yet again demonstrated the fact that the people of 
                Kashmir have rebuffed terrorism from across the border.

The people of Jammu, 
                Kashmir and Ladakh have faith in democracy. They want peace. They 
                would like to see happiness return to their lives. 

Those people who, 
                while talking about Kashmir, advocate the right to self-determination, 
                wish to divide India on communal lines for the second time. They 
                will not be allowed to succeed in this.
 
This year, more than 
                one lakh tourists went to Kashmir. There was a large turnout of 
                pilgrims going on the Amarnath yatra. Nearly six thousand students 
                from different parts of India are today studying in Kashmir. Next 
                week, we shall launch mobile telephone services in the State. 
                

The knotty issues 
                in Jammu and Kashmir can be unraveled only through dialogue. We 
                shall take forward the efforts that have been initiated in this 
                direction. People who have been uprooted have to be resettled 
                in their homes.

Dear Countrymen, 
                the progress that India has made in recent years has given 
                me new hope and confidence.



An India, which was used to borrowing 
                  from abroad has started lending to others.


An India that was perennially 
                  troubled by a paucity of foreign exchange, has today accumulated 
                  nearly US $ 100 billion of foreign exchange reserves.


The prices of essential commodities 
                  are under control. There is no shortage of anything in the market.


Poverty is declining. It is our 
                  resolve to eradicate it faster.



There are no waiting 
                lists now for telephone or gas connections. The number of mobile 
                phone users has gone up from 8 lakh to 1.5 crores. In the coming 
                year, 1.5 crore more mobile customers will be added. 

We are all aware 
                of the poor condition of our roads. Even fifty years after Independence, 
                there were nearly two lakh villages, which were unconnected by 
                proper roads. For the first time, the Centre has started the Pradhan 
                Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana to connect them with good roads.

In the first five 
                decades of Independence, only 550 kilometers of four-lane highways 
                were built. In other words, only 11 kilometers a year. Now, we 
                will build 24,000 kilometers of highways at the rate of 11 kilometers 
                a day. 

The Rs. 54,000-crore 
                National Highways Development Project is progressing rapidly. 
                Three lakh people are working on it everyday. Next year, this 
                number will go up to six lakh per day.

Lakhs of young Indians 
                have got attractive employment in the field of computers. Sitting 
                in our cities, they are providing services to hospitals, factories, 
                and offices in various countries. Software exports have zoomed 
                from Rs. 8,000 crore to nearly Rs. 50,000 crore.

Our country is now 
                ready to fly high in the field of science. I am pleased to announce 
                that India will send her own spacecraft to the moon by 2008. It 
                is being named Chandrayaan I.

We have increased 
                the amount of lending to agriculture and related sectors. Interest 
                rates have been reduced. We shall soon constitute a National Kisan 
                Commission to encourage new experiments in farming, promote investments 
                in agriculture, and study the various problems faced by our farmers.

The Green Revolution 
                and the White Revolution of previous decades have imparted much 
                strength to Indian agriculture. Now India needs a new revolution 
                 the Food Chain Revolution. Its aim is to achieve a doubling 
                of the average income of the Indian farmer by 2010. An important 
                part of this revolution is to reduce wastage of foodgrains, fruits 
                and vegetables worth thousands of crores each year.

Based on the success 
                of Kisan Credit Cards, we have decided to provide credit card 
                facility to all eligible artisans, weavers, and fishermen. The 
                rate of interest on loans given to them will be reduced to 9 percent 
                a year. A contributory insurance scheme will also be started for 
                their benefit.

Under the Antyodaya 
                Anna Yojana, 1.5 crore poorest families in the country are being 
                given 35 kilos of foodgrains each month at the rate of Rs. 2 a 
                kilo of wheat and Rs. 3 a kilo of rice. Never before were foodgrains 
                provided at such cheap prices. This is the largest food security 
                program in the world.

With the launch of 
                the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, no child, especially the girl child, 
                will be deprived of primary education. To implement this program 
                effectively, 2.5 lakh new teachers will be appointed this year 
                itself.

The Mid-Day Meal 
                Scheme for children up to class five is going on in some States. 
                Now, we have decided to run it throughout the country. Later, 
                this will be extended to students up to class ten. This National 
                Program will be known as ""Akshaypatra"". I appeal to 
                voluntary organizations, religious establishments and womens 
                self-help groups to come forward to implement this program in 
                an effective way.

I know what people 
                in under-developed States have to suffer due to the lack of good 
                hospital services there. Therefore, under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya 
                Suraksha Yojana, six new hospitals with modern facilities, like 
                those available at AIIMS in Delhi, will be established in backward 
                States in the next three years.

Friends, 
                for decades a debate was going on about a project to link our 
                rivers, as a way of freeing India from the curse of floods and 
                droughts. Now we have taken up this challenge. I am pleased to 
                inform you that work on two river-linking projects, with the cooperation 
                of State Governments, will be taken up before the end of this 
                year. We will mobilize necessary resources for these projects.

Never before had 
                housing construction taken place at the kind of speed witnessed 
                in the past five years. Never before were housing loans available 
                at such low rates as now. Lakhs of people have got employment 
                in the housing sector.

India has limitless 
                potential in tourism. Take the case of this historic Red Fort 
                itself. It has been taken up for comprehensive restoration for 
                the very first time in its 350 years. I can see that a beautiful 
                garden is coming up in the ground in front of me. It can be befittingly 
                called the ""August 15 Park"".

I would like you 
                too to emulate this example by undertaking such beautiful projects 
                for the conservation of heritage in your own village or town.

The over-riding objective 
                of our policy of economic reforms is just this: We want to create 
                a dynamic economy that not only succeeds against global competition, 
                but is also caring and compassionate towards the poor and the 
                neglected. 

We express our condolences 
                for those who have become victims of untimely death in recent 
                mishaps and natural calamities.

Sisters and 
                brothers, the hands of young Indians are today scripting 
                Indias bright future. An ancient nation with a history of several 
                thousand years has once again become a Young Nation and is all 
                set to create a new history. 

Today, in this nation 
                of a 100 crore people, 60 crore are less than thirty years old. 
                This generation is better educated than any generation in the 
                past, and more ambitious than any generation in the past. It is 
                a generation that has made up its mind not to fall behind anyone 
                in the world in this age of competition.

Today, the doors 
                of opportunity are opening up for our young people all over the 
                world. These opportunities will only increase in the coming years 
                and decades. Therefore, we should educate our youth in science, 
                technology and other new disciplines from now itself.

I appeal to all, 
                that we listen to the heartbeats of this Young India; that we 
                understand the dreams of this Young India; that we encourage this 
                Young India in every way possible; and, that we give proper guidance 
                to this Young India.

Countrymen, 
                today there is a paramount need that we maintain peace in our 
                society and strengthen the bonds of brotherhood. Development requires 
                peace, goodwill and mutual cooperation. Those who wish to divide 
                the society on the basis of religion, caste or community are doing 
                harm to the country.

India is a multi-religious 
                nation. It is against both its nature and culture to practice 
                discrimination or to do injustice to anybody on the grounds of 
                faith. We should always care for the minorities and be attentive 
                towards their welfare.

Peace talks in the 
                North-Eastern States are yielding positive results. The hands 
                that took up the gun now wish to participate in the development 
                of their region. The Government is ready to welcome them.

Friends, 
                it is our responsibility  the responsibility of the Government 
                as well as of the society  that we provide equal opportunities 
                to our brethren belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes 
                and Backward Classes and make them partners in the system. To 
                ensure that economic and social justice fully reaches them is 
                not only our Constitutional duty but also our moral obligation.

We have removed the 
                difficulties that had cropped up in the proper implementation 
                of the policy on reservations. Untouchability in our society is 
                on the decline. However, we have to completely remove this blot.

We have established 
                a new ministry for the development of Adivasis. We have also set 
                up a separate Commission for them. For the first time in fifty 
                years, the list of Scheduled Tribes has been revised and over 
                a hundred new communities have been added to the list.

Friends, 
                after the experience so far, I have come to the conclusion that 
                there is an imperative need for greater commitment and accountability 
                in our system of governance, which has the responsibility of implementing 
                policies and decisions. There is delay in government offices even 
                for getting the right work done. Delays breed corruption.

My Government is 
                prepared to fight corruption at all levels. We have decided to 
                enact the Lok Pal Bill, which had been pending for several decades. 
                In spite of opposition from some people, I have personally brought 
                the Prime Minister within the ambit of its investigation, so that 
                you can even book your Prime Minister if he commits any wrong.

Stringent steps are 
                being taken against economic offenders. 

Sisters and 
                brothers, the Government of the National Democratic Alliance 
                has completed five years. All the previous experiments in running 
                coalition Governments at the Centre had failed. We have succeeded. 
                

Today there is a 
                tremendous hunger for development among the people. They want 
                such a stable government which is determined to improve their 
                living conditions and also capable of doing so.

In our polity today, 
                there is, on the one hand, a growing trend towards wanting to 
                work together, but, on the other hand, there is also a scenario 
                of disarray.

Our States have governments 
                of different political parties. The Centre has established cooperative 
                relations with them. Political discrimination on account of ideological 
                differences is unacceptable to us. 

The proposal to reserve 
                33% seats for women in Parliament and State Legislatures, as a 
                means of womens empowerment, has now become a national resolve. 
                Today, there are over 10 lakh women members in our panchayats 
                and municipal bodies. I congratulate them for their good work.

However, it is regrettable 
                that it has become difficult to pass the Bill for Womens Reservation 
                in its original form because of a lack of consensus in Parliament.

Now a new proposal 
                has been brought forward that seeks to create 33% double- member 
                seats, in which one of them is reserved for women. This is a practical 
                suggestion. All the supporters of womens reservation should consider 
                it with a positive outlook. If there is any other suggestion on 
                which a consensus is possible, the same should be implemented. 
                There should be no further delay in realizing this goal, for which 
                our sisters have been waiting for a long time.

Dear Countrymen, 
                today the nation is at such a turning point from where it can 
                take a big leap forward. The yearning to achieve the lofty vision 
                of making India a Developed Nation by 2020 is gathering strength 
                all over the country.

In just one generation, 
                India can be liberated from the curse of poverty, unemployment 
                and underdevelopment. This is not a daydream. It can be turned 
                into reality. Many countries in the world have demonstrated it.

Look behind a little. 
                India has marched forward by overcoming many a formidable crisis. 
                Today, when the era of resurgence has arrived, why should there 
                be any doubt in anyones mind?

What is needed is 
                only this:



That all of us move together.


That all of us move with discipline.


That we adopt a new work culture.


That we work with a long-term 
                  perspective.



When this ancient 
                and great nation combines talent and hard work, and strives its 
                utmost in pursuit of a common vision, it will certainly succeed 
                in building a bright future for itself.

Nearly 40 years ago 
                I had written a poem, from which I would like to present a few 
                lines to you.

 
Together, we have 
                to march

Obstacles will 
                come, let them.
Dark clouds of 
                apocalypse will gather, let them.
Even if embers 
                smolder under our feet,
Or flames rain 
                over our heads,
Smilingly, we 
                shall light the fire
With our own hands, 
                and burn,
But together, 
                we have to march.

 
In laughter or 
                in grief, in hurricanes,
In immortal sacrifices 
                beyond count,
In greens or in 
                ruins,
In insults or 
                in accolades,
In pain, too, 
                
We have to thrive
Heads held high, 
                hearts swelled with pride. 
Together, we have 
                to march.

Thank you.

Sisters, brothers 
                and dear children, join me in saluting:

Jai Hind!	 
                Jai Hind!	 Jai Hind!""

"
2000," Following is the free rendering of the Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee's speech from ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of Independence Day, here today:

    ""My heartiest congratulations to all of you on the anniversary of our Independence. Wherever you may be — at the highest mountain peaks of the Himalayas or on the shores of the Indian Ocean; on the desert sands of Rajasthan or in the green jungles of the North East, may my greetings reach all of you.

    Today is also the festival of Raksha Bandhan. The power of friendship can transform even a simple hand-spun thread into an unbreakable relationship. On this auspicious occasion, I extend my good wishes to all of you, especially to all my sisters.

    This is the first Independence Day of the new century. While looking back at the century just past, we must work hard to convert the challenges of the new century into opportunities.

    We must make our Independence last forever. We must reiterate, today, our resolve to defend our nation.

    Today is a day of sacred remembrance. It is a moment for introspection. We offer our heartfelt gratitude to all the known and unknown martyrs. The memory of their martyrdom will forever live on in our hearts. Their sacrifices will always inspire us.

    Today, we especially remember Mahatma Gandhiji. He was not only the foremost leader of our Freedom Struggle, but he was also among the greatest personalities of the 20th century.

    On today’s auspicious day, we extend our greetings to the people of all the countries in the world. We wish that the 21st century would bring the message of peace, fraternity, cooperation, and steady progress for the entire world.

    Today, we send our best wishes to millions of Non-Resident Indians and Persons of Indian Origin living in other countries. Wherever they may live, they are always emotionally attached to India. We wish all of them success and prosperity.

    Today, I extend my felicitations to the people of the three new States that have found their place on the map of India after the reorganisation of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar. We are confident that the new States of Chhattisgarh, Uttaranchal, and Jharkhand will soon earn their rightful place in the Union of India.

    We have succeeded in our commitment of creating these three new States. After the formation of these states, we have to work together for their development so that they become shining examples of success.

    The new century is a Century of the Youth. India, too, which has lived for thousands of years, has now become a young nation. Nearly seventy percent of our population is less than the age of 35. These young men and women are more ambitious, more aware, and more active than their predecessors. They not only think big, but they also work hard to realise their dreams.

    I have full faith in India’s youth. It is our responsibility to fully support our young men and women in building a bright future for themselves and their Motherland.

    Dear Countrymen, last year when I had addressed you from the ramparts of this very Red Fort, our country was going through an extraordinary situation. The Lok Sabha had been dissolved and fresh elections announced. It was in these circumstances, that we had to face the aggression in Kargil. And India emerged victorious in this war.

    One year later, democracy has become stronger in the country. India’s international standing has risen. Our voice is being heard attentively in the capitals of the world.

    India is on the move. An India full of self-confidence is marching forward on the path to progress.

    It is an India that is as determined to win against all adversities as were our brave jawans and airmen who drove back the enemy’s forces.

    Our hearts are filled with ever-lasting gratitude towards the brave soldiers of the Kargil and all previous wars.

    Pakistan would be committing a terrible folly if it thinks that it can secure anything through the undeclared war that it has been waging against India. Kashmir has been an unbreakable part of India, and it will remain so.

    Our neighbour must realise that the clock cannot be turned back. I would advise the rulers and also the people of Pakistan to pay heed to the following verse from the lyricist, Sahir Ludhianvi:

 r150820001.jpg (30004 bytes)

Gone is that time, gone is that age,

When ""Two Nations"" was the slogan;

Gone are those people—

Whose purpose was Partition!

One, now, are all Indians,

One, now, are all Indians,

Oh India. know this!

Oh World, know this!

Oh World, know this!

    The 21st century does not permit the redrawing of borders either in the name of religion or on the strength of the sword. This is the age for resolving differences, not for prolonging disputes.

    The people of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh are tired of violence and bloodshed. They are craving for peace. We need to apply the salve of brotherhood on the wounded body of Jammu and Kashmir.

    That is why, I recently said that India is prepared to apply the balm for Kashmir’s agony within the framework of Insaniyat (humanity).

    The world knows who has derailed the move to end hostilities and to start the peace process. The world knows who has torpedoed these efforts.

    On the one hand, Pakistan says it is willing to participate in talks. On the other hand, it continues to be deeply involved in violence, killings, and cross-border terrorism. Activities of the terrorists and proposals for peace talks cannot go together.

    India’s willingness and ability to deal firmly with violence, terrorism, extremism, and separatism should not be underestimated.

    Dear Countrymen, we have to build a magnificent nation. There is no other country in the world, which is so ancient, so big, so populous, and so rich in diversities; that has preserved its democracy, its unity, and its culture; and that is fast emerging as a modern and prosperous nation.

    We have achieved success, too, in this endeavor. Every section of our society has contributed to this success.

    In the present times, India is called upon to pursue two major imperatives. These are: Security and Development. They are complementary to each other. Without security, there can be no development; without development, our security is incomplete.

    Now we have to make determined efforts to meet the economic challenges before the nation. We have to accelerate and broaden our development process, so that no child of Mother India remains hungry, homeless, unemployed, or is without access to medical care.

    We have to reduce regional and social disparities.

    We have to make our brethren belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, and minorities equal partners in our developmental process.

    Therefore, let us together resolve to make this decade, the Decade of Development.

    To realise this goal, we have decided to achieve the target of doubling India’s per capita income in the next ten years.

    Dear Countrymen, to achieve this ambitious target, we have to undertake many important reforms in our economy. At the same time, we need to implement necessary reforms in our administration, our judiciary, in education, and in other areas.

    Reforms are the need of the hour. For example, the world has changed much in the last fifty years; and so has India. There have been many far-reaching political and economic transformations throughout the globe.

    To reform is to turn the inevitability of change in the direction of progress.

    To reform is to improve the life of every citizen.

    Take for example, the reforms in the power sector that the Centre and various State Governments are presently carrying out. These will reduce the losses of our electricity boards, stop the theft of power, and ensure adequate availability of power for increasing production and employment.

    Similarly, the reforms that we are implementing in the telecom sector will enable us to provide cheaper telephones, mobile phones, and Internet services in all parts of the country.

    There is no scope for either apprehension or fear about our economic reforms. I remember that some people had expressed similar fears even during the Green Revolution. These fears later proved to be baseless.

    The perspective of our economic reforms is based on our own concept. You know that almost all political parties have, at different times, and in different ways at the Centre and in different States, been adopting the economic reforms programme.

    I urge our farmers, workers, other producers, industrialists, and our intelligentsia to contribute to building a consensus in favour of the economic reforms.

    In this connection, I would like to express my special appreciation to all the central trade unions. I met their leaders three days ago, and we had a very constructive dialogue. They have withdrawn their proposed nation-wide strike. The interests of our workers will be fully taken into account in the economic reform process.

    This year, the Government is going to take many big and important steps to accelerate our economic and social development and bring its benefits to the largest number of people.

    I wish to congratulate our farmers for ensuring that we have not faced a scarcity of foodgrains despite a rapidly rising population. Today, there is no shortage of food; rather there is a shortage of facilities to store our food stocks.

    We have formulated a National Agriculture Policy for the first time since Independence. This Policy aims to increase agricultural production by four percent every year. Concrete steps would be taken to check the declining investments in the agricultural sector and to facilitate increase in these investments.

    For the first time since Independence, the Central Government has devised a well-conceived and time-bound programme for rural roads. This hundred per cent Centrally sponsored scheme, which is called the ""Prime Minister’s Rural Roads Scheme"", aims to connect, within the next three years, every village that has a population of more than one thousand, through good all-weather roads. In the next seven years, every village with a population of more than five hundred will be similarly connected. For this project, the Central Government is making a provision of Rs. 5,000 crore in its first year. It will be launched on Gandhi Jayanti this year.

    The National Highway Development Project is an ambitious one. A four-lane Golden Quadrilateral connecting Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, and Chennai will be ready by 2003. The North-South and East-West corridors will be ready by 2007.

    Khadi, village industries, and small-scale industries are the backbone of India’s economy. We would like the benefits of economic reforms to reach them too. There will be a national convention of small-scale and cottage industries on the 30th of this month, where we shall announce many important decisions.

    In a very short time, India has become a strong power in Information Technology. In software exports alone, India is expected to have exports of more than Rs.2,00,000 crore by 2008. Through this, lakhs of educated persons are likely to get attractive employment opportunities, both in India and abroad.

    To reach the benefits of Information Technology to the common people, our Government has taken many important decisions in the last two years, and will take many more in future.

    I want to see every school and every village to have access to computers and the Internet in as less time as possible.

    We are committed to ensuring that every village and hamlet gets access to clean drinking water in the next four years. This year, the allocation for the scheme has been increased by Rs. 2,000 crore and its implementation will be intensified.

    Before the end of this year, the Government will announce an Integrated National Health Policy, the aim of which will be to quickly achieve ""Health For All"". The policy will also ensure that every citizen is provided with primary health care. Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy will be given their rightful place.

    Recently, the rapidly spreading disease of HIV/AIDS has become a grave challenge to our nation. I appeal to all sections of society to fully participate in building awareness about this epidemic. They should also make necessary changes in their behaviour so that this disease can be controlled.

    The most valuable investment that we can make in India’s future is to ensure that every child gets education. We have decided that by 2010, every Indian child will get education up to class eight. We have launched Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All campaign) to achieve this goal. Education until graduation has been made free for women. All poor families should take advantage of this.

    Science and technology have become the main engine of economic growth. We should ensure that every vehicle of economic development is equipped with this engine. Towards this end, the Government is taking concrete steps to remove the gap between academia and industry.

    Dear Countrymen, a bright future is knocking at India’s door. We can, however, realise this future to the extent that we are able to further strengthen our national unity, secularism, social goodwill, and our democratic system.

    India is a land of diversities. We have, in ample measure, geographical diversities; linguistic diversities; religious diversities; and diversities in customs and traditions. Despite these diversities, or perhaps because of them, India has always remained united.

    We are one in many, and many in one. The whole world is amazed at how India has successfully sustained this magic not just today, but for many millennia.

    This may be magic for the rest of the world; but for Indians, it is life itself.

    Religious intolerance and hate have never been part of India’s liberal culture. I appeal to the people of all faiths and castes not to create imaginary enemies, and not to resort to the path of using the sword that inflicts wounds on oneself.

    Recently, a few unfortunate incidents have spoiled communal peace and goodwill, in some places. The Government will not tolerate the activities of any organisation that spreads communal discord or incites violence.

    As Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar said, our independence is incomplete without social justice. In the new century, India needs more social justice. However, that kind of social justice (Samajik Nyay) is needed which also promotes social harmony (Samajik Samarasata).

    The policy of reservations is one of the important guarantors of social justice for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. The problem of backlog in reservations was persisting for some time. Recently, we amended the Constitution and solved this problem.

    Women are the backbone of our social system and culture. Our dreams of India’s future can only be realised if our women are educated, are made economically prosperous, are empowered politically, and are enabled to play a bigger role in society.

    We have promised to provide reservations to women in the Parliament and the State Legislatures. There is now a need to quickly bring about a consensus to implement this revolutionary idea. I have had several opportunities to meet many women who have become members and chairpersons of panchayats and municipalities by winning from reserved seats. They have, through their performance, proved that they are not second to men, either in the democratic process or in administration.

    The North-Eastern States have a special place in the nation’s life and in India’s development. The implementation of developmental projects and programmes has been suffering from many hurdles. Now, a special cell has been created in the Prime Minister’s Office to remove these hurdles and speed up the developmental process. This cell will closely monitor the developmental works in the region. There has been an improvement in the situation, thanks to the cooperation of the people and State Governments of this region.

    It is sad that the biggest impediment to faster development in the North-East has been the extremist organisations that are fomenting violence and trouble in the region. I appeal to the leaders and followers of these organisations to give up this dangerous and futile path. The Government is presently engaged in talks with some organisations in the region so that peace and development can be restored in the North-East. I am confident that these efforts will bear fruit.

    India is a Union of States. Our States have an important role to play in ensuring that the fruits of development reach every Indian home. We are committed to decentralisation of power. We have decided to give our States more financial and administrative powers. We would like our Panchayati Raj institutions to also benefit from decentralization of power, so that their functioning becomes more efficient and effective. We have taken concrete steps in this direction.

    In the last two-and-a-half years, we have made continuous efforts to increase dialogue and coordination between the Centre and the State Governments. All States have contributed to this process. This has improved cooperation and concord between the Centre and the States. Consequently, there has been an increasing convergence in our viewpoints and goals. For this, I thank all the State Governments and their Chief Ministers.

    We shall intensify our campaign against corruption in high places. Our country cannot make expected progress in development without probity in administration and in public life.

    One of the big failings in our national life has been that people expect the Government to solve even those problems, which they could easily resolve through their collective efforts. The Government, after all, has limited resources. In addition, experience has shown us that, those programmes which are implemented without people’s participation, rarely yield the expected results.

    Let me illustrate. Be it population stabilisation or dealing with natural calamities, conserving water and electricity, or keeping our public places clean and beautiful—all these initiatives can succeed only when our citizens participate enthusiastically and in an organised manner.

    Dear Countrymen, on the first Independence Day of the 21st century, let us draw inspiration from all the good and glorious aspects of our past. However, let us not become obsessed with the past.

    I have been emphasising repeatedly that India should turn its attention to the challenges and opportunities of the future. We should not be stuck in the contentious issues of the past.

    Come, let us look to the future. We have to create a prosperous, self-reliant, and self-confident India. Indeed, we have already embarked along this path. We will march further in this direction. We are being counted among the ranks of successful nations.

    We must not stop. Rather, we must step up the speed of our journey.

    I call upon our farmers, workers, artisans, employees, youth, and, indeed, all our citizens, to make their contribution to a happy and prosperous India.

    I ask our entrepreneurs to hoist the flag of their capabilities and prowess and demonstrate to the rest of the world that Indian industrialists are second to none in any competition.

    I appeal to the Non-Resident Indians to contribute their fullest to this momentous task.

    I exhort our scientists and engineers that they scale new heights of knowledge and science to earn a bright name for themselves and their country.

    I appeal to India’s sportspersons that they take our tricolor to triumphant positions in the arena of international sports.

    The entire nation sends its best wishes to our sports contingent that is taking part in next month’s Olympic Games at Sydney.

    Come, let all of us contribute our mite to the creation of a Parishrami Bharat (industrious India), Parakrami Bharat (achieving India), and a Vijayi Bharat (winning India).

    Our motto for all ages has been:

 r150820002.jpg (10159 bytes)

Let us walk together

Let us speak in one voice

Let our hearts beat together

    In other words, let us march forward united —all of us together, and taking everybody together.

    Let us make the 21st Century, India’s Century.

    This is our resolve. This is our aspiration.

    Thank you.

    Jai Hind!"
